1,Feminism is a hate group by any rational standard. Feminists are hateful people.,1
2,What a load of crap  get over it already. You still dont have a clue      heard a story shame. create your own wealth through Black Monopoly Capital and less corruption from your fat cat Politicians who are stealing your future but you so blinded by your own prejudices that you cant see the wood for the trees  There ARE NO MORE  whites left for your pathetic story. There are now MORE black millionaires than white ones in South Africa. Go do your homework and stop playing the victim you are one of the PRIVILEGED BLACKS AND HAVE NO idea what you talking about. ,1
3,I am NOT protecting or condoning the alleged behavior  Im pointing out the he did this because he is gay bigotry.,1
4,Yah yah he is the terminator   You girly men out there   Get to the gym and pump yourself up. Yaah.,1
5,Islam frightens me when I think of my daughters future in an islamized Canada.  This is not an irrational fear not a phobia when you look at whats happening in the world today.,1
6,That was ...... gay lol what are you woot wooting about???? Find some candy in your pocket?,1
7,She probably was the only black female applicant at that time...,1
8,Yes...its the homo stuff.   Deal with it.,1
9,Any word from tRump about white extremist terrorists in this country? No. Because they are inspired by him.,1
10,Is there a formula that newspapers have to adhere to. Muslims commit mass murder against Infidels. Next day authorities are blamed. The Muslim community is canvassed and they are all in shock. Western liberals change their Facebook profile page and burn a candle and talk about carrying on. The following day is the Muslim as victim narrative day. Islamaphobia is the soup de jour that day. What sick twisted selfloathing world do you journalists live in?,1
11,Why the emphasis on her religion?  Another misguided attempt by the MSM to make the muderers into the victims no doubt.  Meanwhile muslims keep killing.,1
12,Thats a bit misleading. 1000 open investigations into domestic terror including SOME of which were white supremacists. There was Obamas buddy Bill Ayers.,1
13,You are no conservative. Just plain ol white trash.,1
14,Suggest you check with a Muslim scholar.  Youre wrong. Its a fashion imposed by insecure smallminded misogynic imbeciles precisely the type males the progressive world including our Feminist PM will shun in a heartbeat. They treat women as chattels ignore their basic human rights subjugate them and their daughters from morning to night.  They are barbaric in outlook with scant respect for human life.  Their views toward women are abhorrent.,1
15,At least no one died besides the shooter.  I hope Trump bombs another Muslim country,1
16,Calling someone white trash is definitely racism thanks for playing.,0
17,When the Yazidi women and children are being raped murdered andor murdered by ISIS Justin condemns them for fearing Islam.  Remember it...,0
18,"People have always had different views on the UK and on the world. To suggest that immigrants are replacing the British is the result of racism, saying that they do not fit here is just wishful thinking.",0
19,The idea that migrants are merely happy-go-lucky people with no code of their own is just wrong.,0
20,Many cultures and religions have co-existed peacefully for hundreds if not thousands of years. What you are saying is simply not true.,0
21,"Does that mean Jews as a 2,5% minority can control all levels of government? In a democratic country, we believe that every minority should be represented in the government and it guarantees that noone has total control over anything.",0
22,"We're all entitled to work in this country, irrespective of our sexual orientation.",0
23,Yes keep the blame game going on someone who is not even President yet Last time we checked the bag lady with the pointy hat and broom lost....too bad...so sad....NOT Join the Marxistfeminist gender bender crybabies and their latte sipping hipsters at the nearest cafe if you dont like democracy in action,0
24,Many Muslims live in the UK. They are our neighbours and we should welcome them.,0
25,"Muslims are part of Europe, since the beginning. For example, in the 1970s they made up the 2% of the French population.",0
26,"By definition, refugees are fleeing out of fear for themselves and families, rather than thinking too much about their final destination. The majority still find safety in neighbouring countries.",0
27,This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others.,0
28,"This is not true. Being gay is not synonymous with being bisexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, queer, deviant, lesbian, tranny, queermetaphysical, or whatever term you want to use... We should try to respect people for who they are instead.",0
29,"Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community.",0
30,Who do you think tRump is hiring to operate all of his bankrupt investments?  MEXICANS AND HISPANICS.  Yuk yuk yuk.,0
31,Do you deny the white supremacists want to be rid of anyone not just like them and that they believe the deaths of Jews Blacks and Latinos would be just fine?,0

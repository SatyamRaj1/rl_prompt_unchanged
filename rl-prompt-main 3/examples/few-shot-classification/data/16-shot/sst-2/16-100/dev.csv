0,I didnt vote for Obama because he is bl6 nor did I vote for Clinton because she is a woman,1
1,The homicide rate in Germany is the lower than the USA. I suppose the Americans too should get rid of all their Muslim citizens in order to reduce gang violence?,1
2,Femininity is toxic.  Women dont have to be.,1
3,If you watch the evening news at all year after year  it is impossible to ignore the fact that a very disproportionate share of violent crime comes from the nonwhite community.,1
4,We just got forced to give money to a belief system preaching planned parenthood which believes a child is nothing until it breaths air and that homosexuality and promiscuity are fine even transgendering.  Wake up people  Belief systems abound and need to be exposed.,1
5,Black lives matter. Why are there so many black on black homicides? Respect one another first then others will regard you with respect.,1
6,Why is it Wavemaker that people like you refuse to admit that the crime and drug problem is perpetrated mostly  by blacks you have to identify the problem before it can be solved I didnt bring race up at all in this post  however roughly   70 to 75 of the crime  is perpetrated by blacks and until people like you Obama and Clinton  talk about it it will never change  the same way liberals refuse to say Islamic radicalism.,1
7,That would be just another nail in the coffin.  Ordination of women would likely be a rolling dumpster fire.,1
8,My post was civil.  I think I must have asked too many sensible questions that someone didnt want other people to think about such as What were Black people doing when they were shot by police? and also something about numbers of Blacks shot by police vs Blacks shot by Blacks.,1
9,The Justice Department sued Trump  twice  for not renting to black people,1
10,Also Remember Catholic laity are amongst the most supportive of civil marriage equality.  If so then this Catholic laity is facilitating one of the worst violations of Catholic teaching and promoting one of the greatest hoaxes on mankind which is that the sexual union of two gays can be a marriage.,1
11,Im aware that Hitler was an animal lover and vegetarian. He was also a mass murderer which was my point.  Not sure what yours is it appears to be just more whataboutism from a likely Trump voter since they engage in that ridiculous red herring in order to try and conflate the real issue in order to try and cover up their own wrongdoing and hypocrisy.  Check out the series on Netflix  Einsatzgruppen: The Nazi Death Squads. I suspect youll really enjoy it.  You might even pick up some pointers to use when you initiate your Feral Cat Death Squads. After all the Nazis took slaughter house practices and used them to kill Jews and others they considered vermin.,1
12,That only works when vermin like Muslims arent involved in the mix.,1
13,Didnt this mudshark and her nigger get killed by another nigger in a high drug area?? They were probably going to buy drugs. Oh well no big loss.,1
14,15 year old kids especially Muslims know exactly what they are doing they know what blood tastes like and are in no way innocent. That young Muslim man  deserves incarceration and the punishment that is owed to him.   When resources in this world become scarce and but one piece of bread is left on the table the Muslim man will slit your throat to have it but the Christian man will make sure that the piece is shared amongst us all.,1
15,Its like Muslim refugees coming to Canada. . Saudi Arabia Kuwait  and Dubai dont want them.,1
16,"We should remember that a large part of humanity is not defined by physical or mental limitations, but rather by character, work ethic, and values.",0
17,The UK has always been a melting pot of cultures and humanity. We are stronger together than apart. How would the immigrants represent an 'attack' to the west?,0
18,"Wars can be stopped, but the real question is how to stop the suffering of people not expected to pay the price. Allowing hatred to rule will eventually bring about the same result as a Civil War: more deaths and misery, if there is one lesson learned from history it is that the potential for good is much greater than the probability of evil.",0
19,"Given that some studies show that some immigrants are not only good workers but also contribute to our country, this assertion of yours just isn't based upon facts..",0
20,You can't blame Islam for every problem in the world.,0
21,Let's be realistic: how would you feel about being verbally harassed by a Muslim in public? Harassment is never a good idea. Acceptance is.,0
22,Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.,0
23,"We shouldn't ignore that immigration contrbutes in many ways to our society, and therefore to exclude people is not a wise or sensible strategy.",0
24,What anger toward women?  I hate double standards.,0
25,There are thousands of Jews living in many European countries. I don't see how this is a problem. Can you explain this point better?,0
26,"Islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the Western values you mean?",0
27,Maybe Lassner is afraid that he would be fired if he took action against Herron.  What a sad case of an idiotic society where one race can say racist remarks towards all other races while being protected by punishing those who say racist remarks towards that race...in this case Blacks.  I dont see many other races being represented in the math department  It looks like only whites and blacks want to lazy jobs that only requires one to teach the same thing year in and year out.,0
28,Jewish people were persecuted because they were seen as different. In the end we all are humans and such an exclusionary perspective is just not helpful.,0
29,How do you know that they are practicing devil worship?,0
30,"The West has always been a better place with women as equals. And, if you really want to know why, you could look at the ""Usborne Book of Famous Women"" for example. You would understand.",0
31,We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity.,0

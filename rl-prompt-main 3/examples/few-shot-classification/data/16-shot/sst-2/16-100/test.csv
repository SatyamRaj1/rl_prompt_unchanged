54,Stop the Muslim hoards before we ruin Canada. In fact stop immigration period.,1
55,Its not their land. So nothing to take from them. In the late 1940s the stupid Arabs went to war with the Jews and lost badly ending up with little or nothing.

They have pretended to be inclusive but given a chance to show what they really admire you get to see where they come from and at are going.  The party is shrinking to a small band of hateful morons based in Alberta and driven by the uneducated banjo pickers in the rural areas of Canada.

80,It pleases me to no end to see the settlers finally being held accountable for their words and actions.  We have gotten used to having our way because of white privilege so it helps to see that rather than hiding behind white privilege and the usual exhortations for the darkskinned to get over it were just joking these settlers are held to account.  So far many of us are in agreement that all these claims about free speech is really a lent Arion that white settlers cant make fun of the darkskinned like in the good ol days.,1

For decades Muslim Islamic jihadists have been attacking killing and injuring many innocent civilians in many countries around the world including in countries that arent even fighting against Muslims in the Middle East.  So why are Muslim followers of Islam attacking killing and maiming innocent civilians in many countries around the world? What is influencing inspiring and driving them? What is their goal? What are the Muslim extremists trying to accomplish?  Does it have something to with the religion of Islam the hadiths and the verses in the Quran Muslims are obliged to follow?,1
102,She is first and foremost a Muslim one who submits to the will of Allah: Inshallah. Nothing not even her own life is going to interfere with that. Even as the corpses of victims of Islam pile up she will avert her eyes and blame infidels. Her hijab is her affirmation of Islamic Suprematism.,1
103,I dont particularly care if Margaret Sanger was a racist spoke a KKK rallies and ate black babies. I do think abortion should be an option to women in almost every circumstance.

McHugh.He had a great deal of experience with this phenomenon.  I think anyone interested in this bizarre behavior needs to read it.,1
139,I am sure they are going to come out in droves.  You cant be gay and be conservative.  You cant be gay and be weary of socalled multiculturalism.  You cant be gay and have any opinion that doesnt parrot what some liberal mouthpiece is blabbering.  It is time for gays and women to say Islam is a religion that hates us.,1
140,IF BLM were as concerned about black on black murder none of this would be an issue.,1
141,Dear President Trump and Government: Please do not allow a single additional Muslim into the US. Even if 99 of 100 wont do anything bad we do not need the one who does. And the rest is hostile to our culture anyway they only come for the money. Europe should be a warning example to show what the soft invasion of Muslims does.,1
142,China is looking to be the next great empire.  Control of its citizenry is essential.   Canadians who enable this behaviour are naive.  Or traitors.,1
143,Well the problem did start with Muslim immigrants who refused to assimilate and taught their children not to.  I wonder if Europe also had whiny phony Sikhs paving the way for Muslim accommodation ie bending over backwards and goatseing for them like we did here.  Oooh let us wear our turbans and ugly beards in the RCMP and legion halls because the British like us blah blah blah.  Should have told them to take their nasty turbans back to India so we could also tell Muslims to shove their accommodation up their asses.,1
144,There are gay Jesuits? You amaze me Next thing youll be telling me that there are more gays in the clergyreligious life than there are in the general population,1
145,Why has hatred of muslims been singled out for special treatment?  Hatred of Muslims is emphasized not singled out among all forms of racial and religious discrimination. Thats justifiable at the moment due to the event in Quebec City and the fact that hate crimes against Muslims in Canada have increased considerably over the last two years.,1
146,The picture in the newspaper is interesting.  A presumably black gay female officer is now excluded from a parade that BLM has really nothing to do with.  Amazing,1
147,Why should the gay men of Toronto want anything to do with Pride anymore? Bit by bit year after year  Gay Pride was taken away from us.   Now it has been stolen by  BLM and turned into this farce.   As a gay man I have no link to events anymore. Corporate sponsorship will be next to go . If Pride folds so be it.  We gay guys created Gay Pride 35 years ago and we can create something else to replace it.  Cops in uniform welcome.,1

154,Roof is not really an ignorant redneck or KKK white trashhis family seemed quite welloff when he was a child and according to reports he was bright in school.   Hes clearly not normalhis OCD is likely from Aspergers or autism.  He got into drugs and someone like him very obviously should not have been permitted to carry a gun.,1
155,Further I expect to be killed any day that after being beaten by two big racist rednecks in 2009 because of my race. I was only 65 years old then. Hate speech and racist utterances are prelude to this kind of action. A Muslim wont kill me. An American racist will.,1
156,Over and over in the Muslim bible it tells them to kill all people who will not convert. This is not islamophobia people. This is the right to life I have a right to live knowing if one of their people will kill me as I am a Christian. A Muslim student in the school I work at was screaming Ill kill all Christian s. So tell us again why we shouldnt be afraid??? Please? Tell me???,1

162,John basically your claim is that Catholics are homophobic that orthodox Jews are homophobic and that Muslims are homophobic.  That seems to support a couple of conclusions:  youre intolerant youre a heterophobe.  If the shoe fits wear it.,1
163,Isnt it clear? The Institutional Roman Catholic church wants to rid itself of gay people.  I dont know why gay people their friends families and coworkers choose to remain in what is an abusive relationship.,1
164,um ... gay dudes would never go for that.,1
165,Muslim immigrants most of which want to spread Shira Law across the entire globe and who dont intend or never will assimilate should never be allowed into any sovereign nation....there is too much to lose in every respect.  As to our country no where in out Constitution does it say that we are honor bound to to take in all refugees from anywhere much less the Trojan Horse that is the refugee population from Syria.,1
166,The Chinese made fools of themselves again...showing that theyre petty thieves and even worse liars.,1
167,It is time to close some mosques.  Let the community feel your anger.  Stop making excuses or allowances for Islam. It is not compatible with civilization. They say these losers are not true Muslims?  Then they wont mind if they are buried in a pig sty.,1
168,He looks like one angry white doode....,1
169,Interesting that justins government is not putting forth any motions about antisemitism whose incidents in Canada are three fold greater than Islamophobia. Does that mean a Synagogue has to be invaded and Jews killed in the attack before a motion is put forward or that there are more Muslim votes than Jewish votes?,1
170,If the vast majority of religious based and biased acts of terror were perpetrated by Mormons I would suggest that there is something wrong with the Mormon faith  Similarly  if  the vast majority of religious based and biased acts of terror were perpetrated by Southern Baptists or Buddhists I would suggest that there is something wrong with  these creeds   ergo,1
171,Hes far too bloated to be a member of anything called the master race. White privilege is being a syphilitic tub of lard yet thinking you are a better example of human.,1
172,Actually..right wing Christians have committed more mass murders in US since 911 than Muslims. All generalizations hate and fearmongering aimed at a group of people for the terrible actions of some of them is generally a bad policy and unconstitutional to boot. Totally unacceptable from a public official or media personality.,1
173,Watch that top vid in the beginning where they show the protesters engage.  The supremacist guy charges into the crowd and at 0:20 he swings at a girl and whiffs and she comes after him.  LMAO...what a tough hero  Ok ok...white guys cant box...LMAO....,1

175,You have failed at your attempt to blame the white nan .. when a black officer shoots a white man... No one complains. A white officer shoots a thug... People go nuts.,1
176,Of all the western societies Japan doesnt seem to have a Muslim terrorist problem.  This is because they DO NOT ALLOW the immigration of Muslims.  Sorry but terrorism is baked into that religion and the Japanese know and understand this.  They dont consider it as being racist they consider it being common flipping sense.    When their holy book the Koran specifically instructs its followers to kill the infidels there can be only one eventual outcome murder via terrorism.,1
177,Right...that was prior to 2009 when a black guy became POTUS and lots of insecure white dudes lost their minds...,1
178,God these women are starting to piss me off.They dont like freedom of speech when it hurts their feelings and cannot get over who won the election so they dont believe in democracy.

181,If we should ever have to go to war with Mexico again could we win No more Mexicans and make English only laws,1
182,Why would the daughter of a draft dodger who has just slapped the face of every serving American transgendered person be chosen for a ceremonial task of honour?  Time to for the government to remove her from the guest list.,1
183,Cowardly white whiner hiding in a closet and stolen valor to boot,1

185,Except only whites can be criticized.  If its non white people committing atrocities you cant say anything because the left will name call you racist and try to shut you down.  No asking Muslims to condemn Islamic terrorism which is far more widespread and killing more people that white racism.   Enough of the double standard.  Racism and intolerance comes from many places and peoples.  Hold all people equally accountable.,1
186,Try not to let every Muslim foreigner cut your head off in the name of Allah,1
187,i doubt it. shes on smarm factor 9 and isnt about to get off her stool until the white boys are humiliated to tears.,1
188,And you would know because youre a black man who knows lots of other black people right? Not that youre being patronizing  to black people or anything.,1
189,Some lesbians but mostly by men.  Gays dont recruit.  Pederasts recruit  many in the priesthood and they become gasp priests.,1
190,Trump also says:  Its freezing and snowing in New York  we need global warming  You know it really doesnt matter what the media write as long as youve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.  ... if I were starting off today I would love to be a welleducated black.  My fingers are long and beautiful as it has been well documented are various other parts of my body.  I think the only difference between me and other candidates is that Im more honest and my women are more beautiful.  Black guys counting my money I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are little short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.,1
191,Lying Red Rag. You win this one but your hero Hillary is still going to prison. As should all you islamists.,1
192,Does that mean Jews are cannibals?,1
193,well said Stubble  Hate the religion not the person.  Absolutely nothing wrong with hating a religion.  And heck nothing wrong with hating a hateful person.  But even though I hate Islam and other religions I cant think of any muslims I know that I dislike even.  They are individuals not defined in a black and white way by their religion or ancestry.,1
194,BLM is a political and fascist movement.  Agree with us or suffer the consequences is their motto.  What has everyone learned from this?  If you are black you can defy authority and suffer little or no consequences.  If you are not black and defy BLM be prepared to pay.,1
195,His family should be deported back to Uzbekistan if they are not yet US citizens. If anyone knew it was them.  Uzbekistan should be added to the list of known terrorist countries.,1
196,Trudeau was portrayed by the Harper Conservatives as too young. The Conservatives ran relentless television ads saying he was just not ready.  They turned out to be right on the money. A young man who won for his last name only. Not ready then not ready now. Wheres is he anyway last time I knew he was traveling all over Europe handing out huge amounts of canadian money to  dubious feminist gay and muslim causes. Wheres he now?,1
197,Whack the little fat toad. The chinese cant do anything because they own so much of our debt and depend so much on us buying their trinkets that 3  4 weeks of economic embargo would collapse their economy. We should go to the chinese and let them pick the next ruler for n korea then terminate the greaseball.,1
198,where is our vocal feral cat killing muslim to defend his fellow islamist? must be hiding under his blow up sheep.,1

201,Poor people in third world countries are under attack by christians every daymaybe its time you get your head out of the sand and start paying attention...,1
202,Sadly Trump is the preferred leader of the GOP base of poorly educated white folks that he claims to love. He expresses their fear and rage. They are  terrified of losing the white privilege they claim does not exist. They are also the only demographic  in the country that is dying younger. They are killing themselves with drugs alcohol domestic violence and suicides.  I would pity them if they didnt think killing black folks would solve their problems.,1
203,Hillary Clinton was the most corrupt candidate to ever run for the office of President. Women activists made a big mistake in throwing their support behind her.   As for the demonstration it was your typical vague feelgoody demo that passes for activism these days. Bereft of focus it was just a grabbag of complaints much of which was unfair or out of context. Women in the West for example have the most freedoms and rights as of anywhere in the world. Yet no attempt was made to protest true abuses of women these days primarily taking place in the Islamic sphere. No mention of the sex slavery or the brutal mass murder happening across the Middle East and Africa.   Instead protestors carried signs equating wearing hijabs and burkhas with feminism. Foolish or willing fools? Who knows but it certainly is not feminism.,1
204,Mateen was on a jihad guided by his Imam father  and wife to kill gay men.  He is the poster child  of a  Muslim on a mission.,1
205,Since Islamists have stated that their ultimate goal is to take over the world for Allah by force if necessary it would seem that if youre not Muslim then being Islamophobic would be a wise course of action.,1
206,Women make poor managers.  They dont have any logic theyre not rational ignore evidence and data.  They make decisions based on emotions how they feel that day and whether it will get them browny points with other sea hags.   Thats how our fearless feminist clown boy got elected.,1
207,Palatable of course violence is bad. But one side is advocating the purging of Jews blacks minorities and immigrants from America. The other side is against this. They are not the same regardless of who punched who first. Dont fall for the violence is the issue. White supremacists and Nazis here in America are the issue.,1
208,Muslim ban,1
209,Poor analogy. Both the KKK and the Blacks are Christians. So cross burning is racial not religious. But good try on explaining the silence of Muslims about their religious killers.,1
210,Another Mo...its always the Mos that do this crazy crap...I hate black people that hate white people...just keeps going and going and going..will it ever end with these Mos?,1
211,There are Muslims who ran under the Conservative party and one was elected in the last election. Stop embarrassing yourself.,1

213,Yet another slaughter by an angry white dude in Gunmerica,1
214,How racist of you We all know black people and black secret servicemen arent allowed to eat at Dennys LOL,1
215,Yes these white people for instance Alaska serial killers Israel Keyes Robert Hansen Joshua Wade all reveal they are inhumane arrogant and indifferent to the suffering of women young people Alaska Natives blacks etc.   What do you think should be done about them?,1
216,You hit the nail on the head with your concluding sentence.  To me her ignoring the important black leaders in the room is a far more egregious lack of decorum than putting her feet on the sofa.,1
217,If you are a mainreader of the HuffingGlue Post youd believe such trash. Look at countless online videos that the Media refuses to publish. Youll see the rabid violent zealous hatred of the crazy leftist regressive socalled social justice warriors. When called to back up their claims that Trump is racistthey CANT do it. They just then go on to a frustrated namecalling rant against the person questioning them. Its not racist to want to protect your country. Trump only talked about deporting ILLEGAL Aliens. NOT all Mexicans. And as far as Muslims go.......they are a bigoted sexist homophobic hategroup after all....,1
218,If you work with 4 Catholic priests you should be able to readily get a precise definition of the term Invincible Ignorance.,1
219,To say evangelicals are stupid is no different from saying Catholics or put in any other religious group are stupid.,1
220,Trump is a worthless stain on America. Hes a lying sick fascist white supremacist traitor.,1
221,The U.S armed Islamic psychopaths in Afghanistan during the 80s to fight Russia.  The U.S arms Islamic psychopaths in Syria during this war to fight Russia.  Nothing much has changed....,1
222,white nationalists that kill innocent people are morally no different from muslim terrorists that kill innocent people.,1
223,You answer your own question. Muslims are killing Muslims. Stop killing you own people and you do not need weapon from Canada.,1
224,The leftist media would do its best to make Pence look like the second coming of the antiChrist for gay people were Trump to be impeached  which has a zero chance of happening.,1
225,The Muslims are angry all over the world and they are costing us Trillions of dollars in expenses and security incoveniences. The FLQ did similar things in the 70s in Canada and we expanded French rights all over the country  and the IRA made similar accomplishments in England  too and we sat down and accommodated them even if we didnt like them....what exactly do the radical Muslims want...most of them blame Israel....is that true or not.,1

229,Filthy niggers.,1
230,Liar.  Im considering your idiotic source.  Anyone that carries the name Mohamed shouldnt throw stones.  We dont need any wannabe Muslim bringing bigotry into our great nation.  We already have way too many bigots and racists hurling stones.,1
231,Some of those technologies get bought and shelved by rich white men who want to preserve their fortunes...,1
232,But as you posted this  Latinos are not a race. They are also white  under my comment rest assured I am nonHispanic White.  Not that it matters  at all to me but just sayin,1
233,This international idiot claims to be gay and CONservative.  I heard him on a Bill Maher panel and the only thing this guy has going for him is that he has nothing but dead air space between his ears.  Its hilarious that hes associating with the wrongwingers.  What gay guy wears pearls around his neck and wrists?  Gender confusion for sure.,1
234,Its really sad how when white folks are the victims of such attacks they never go viral in national media.,1
235,LW1. Im 30 and I dont drink do drugs or fall for the feminist crap that modern women are a part of. I also dont appreciate that you put all young women in this nutty modern woman category.,1
236,hey ignorant one there is NO SUCH THING as transgendered... no phenomenon ITS A MENTAL CONDITION  and it is clearly not science,1
237,Shes so right If it wasnt for white privilege I would have never been able to pay for university by working night shifts at minimum wage.,1
238,You assume that mist lesbian or gay male couples yearn for recognition and blessing by the leadership of this sect. Those I know me and mine included do not.,1
239,The sad part of is the Left is thrilled to have face to face confrontations with White Supremecists and Neonazis and happy to incite the violence.  Not question whether the White Supremecists and NeoNazis are scum and thugs  they are  period.    Just saying the left now is using them to paint all conservatives and all opponents as racists. This demonization of regular conservatives both delegitimizes them as having policy alternatives which may be practical in solving issues and also scapegoats them so they should not have freedom of speech and open to hate attacks.  We now need to be clear. Neo nazis are scum. But doesnt mean Black Lives Matter or similar folks are right and not dangerous.,1
240,When Muslim kill Muslim is it Islamophobia or what?,1
241,These tiny examples of Christian love ........ along with cemetaries filled with decaying corpses of self loathing homosexual hierarchs will eventually put an end to this Catholic hatred.,1
242,Great essay Elstun the good ol boy establishment is alive and well in Alaska.  Get ready for comments from the usual suspects.  Especially those that are lesbian phobic.,1
243,The KKK threatens to and does murder blacks that dont comply. The baker walks away with his life. BTW the KKK is a Christian organization. That is what the burning cross is for.,1
244,Lets discuss the evils of the Arabian empires Ottoman Turks and various caliphs  which raged genocide destruction of all preexisting cultures of North African and Middle east. We still have native culture with us in Canada. But Muslims exterminated all indigenous people and religions where ever they went and still try do,1

247,A muslim terrorist from Fairview.  Whodathunk?,1
248,Ah the feminist reformacon shows his stripes.,1
249,The Anchorage Crime report this year said white women are raped in most cases by white men not minority men.   This is for you From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo attorney and bestselling author.  In our nations history so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime no matter how young the victims no matter how much fear is engendered in a community no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender the race itself is never sullied.   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85percent in Latin America she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country America are white men. And last white women are known for killing their children. Any studies to back your gossip?  I am aware of truth. Im an old cops and crime reporter from way back.,1

251,You mean a black man inciting riots and people being murdered by blacks. Snoop dog a piece of crap saying he would not rest till every white woman was a crack whore. Albeit it is a phrase coined elsewhere. Time they were all loaded on a leaky boat and sent back to Africa.,1
252,To save money just simply ban anyone who isnt white  very simple....that is actually zero discriminaton since all are banned except the whitest of whites,1
253,Whos we?  The USA is a racist regime that only invades nonwhite countries.,1

Kick this bum to the curb charge him with treason tear down any and all statues of any trudeau and destroy it. Its our history these scum are trying to remove to replace it  with stinking muslims.,1
258,A bunch of exMarine losers on here defending the systematic torture of these boys. Are we training them to be soldiers or psychopaths? The Muslim recruit was denied medical treatment when he reported his threat closing up later found to be due to strictures in his esophagus from his mistreatment. These D.I.s are disgusting human beings as is anyone who condones this.,1
259,Those pesky social scientist inventing nonsense concepts and words that are never applicable to the institutional Church words like misogyny patriarchy pedophilia monarchy clericalism sexism and FEMINISM  Drat those ignoramuses those faux intellectuals,1
260,All very Christian:  arrogant vain bigoted malicious and wilfully ignorant.,1

262,White people who cook these foods are called racists. White people who dont eat these foods are called racist. its a thrid world of social chaos being preached here.,1
263,You ignored the deaths of white folks in murder suicides. when the wife gets tired of being abused and threatens to leave and take the kids. Her frustrated white husbandbaby daddy kills them all because he loved them so much. Of course the killer needed the gun to defend his family.,1
264,But we arent talking about the Jehovahs Witness or the Hare Krishna here were talking about Islam. There can be no argument that Islam is more than a religion. It seeks to dominate all facets of life. O Prophet Strive hard against the infidels and the hypocrites and be firm against them and their abode is hell and evil is their resort. Holy Quran 66:9. One makes accommodations to Islam at his or her own peril.,1
265,Cant remember the last time someone walked into a Christian church in Canada and opened fire. Or a Christian follower being harassed as they walked down the street. The reason the Canadian Muslim population garners such attention is because they are a target of hate and discrimination.,1
266,This is absurd and beyond insane. His parents and supporters encouraged him and Islam brainwashed him to be a killer.  They must pay  The Cdn taxpayers have nothing to do with his problems so why are they always paying for the stupid white people lack of common sense.,1
267,What are the white supremacists doing thats against the law?  Im sure NAMBLA has meetings.  Is it disgusting...yes.,1
268,may be allah should born all muslims women without face . or they should stay in countries where these thing were invented like burka and all that crap. seems its not muslim women who are protesting it seems like politicians want muslim vote,1
269,White trash POS trump supporters Bring it on.,1
270,You cant compare fanatic mobs with the Muslim or any other mainstream Religion.,1
271,Well in the case of white supremacists you are talking about a fever swamp of domestic terrorism so having a sitting president who is trying not to alienate them as well as inviting scum like Bannon Gorka and Miller into the WH is a very big concern.,1

280,OMG Stop the presses The WH fires its chief usher.  Shes a black immigrant woman and gay.  How disgusting.  How can Trump do such a thing.  I heard Trump personally fired her.  Next hes going to fire the WH gardener.  What is going on?  Lets organize and protest and riot in the streets  Hawaii needs to file a lawsuit.,1
281,SNAP neither confirms nor denies accusations. The do however give victims a voice.  Odd why dont priests stand up alongside the victims? Its a brotherhood thats why.  And those abused and denied a childhood and adulthood are denied by the catholic churchs lobby efforts again horrid,1
282,The hard truth is that many minorities simply cant compete academically with Asian and White students. What most people dont know is that the best predictor of success on the SAT is race not socioeconomic status. Even poor Asian students fresh off the boat will routinely outperform wealthy blacks and Hispanics. This isnt racism. It is what it is.,1
283,Whats principled about it? Shes a Suuni Muslim. She doesnt mind pointing out gender unfairness in Indians especially if theyre Shias. Its ironic though that she talks about gender fairness while wearing that thing around her head in order to protect men from being aroused by the sight of her hair. If she really believes in gender fairness and balance she should not be afraid to expose her head to the sun for a change just like all Muslim men are allowed to do.,1
284,White privilege:  The belief whites are obligated to pay for the sins of my ancestors because others cant assume responsibility of their own lives.,1
285,Ussien Bolt showed more respect to our anthem than Gabby Shes an idiot who got sucked into the political show but her background as a gymnast doesnt jive with 98 of all other athletes and people in the world of real and respect. The only place the skill she learned is going to be useful is at the Olympics no where else because she refused to incorporate discipline and respect into her actions. Stop kissing blacks asses.,1
286,Im happy to see USA bombard ISIS. But if Russia used a big bomb there would be an outcry.  Lets unite to defeat Islamism and Islamic terrorism.,1

288,Thats for white kids different story when you are black,1

292,I wish we could deport American Catholics who play censor on comboxes.     Censoring comments because you disagree with them....how incredibly lame.,1
293,You do white identity politicts. You simply lack the selfawareness to realize it. Please provide an example of the media writing fluff on what a decent citizen a Muslim shooter is.,1
294,Given that a plurality of Americans are happy for monuments celebrating the proslavery Confederate cause to remain standing I wouldnt be so quick to dismiss the reach of white supremacist voices...,1
295,These sort of incidents are just heartbreaking. I suspect that if we had a functioning criminal justice system these white supremacist derriere chapeaux would have long ago found themselves in prison instead of cruising our roadways instigating trouble.,1
296,Uh ok. Maybe we should put a bitter snarky Muslim on the bill.,1
297,Why do Indonesians care? Because Muslim? why does Malala care?  Because she is Muslim?  why does the West have to care? damned if you care and damned if you dont  there are 1500 million Muslims to care why always blame the West,1
298,so the black cop who shot this guy was a full fledged member of this nationwide white supremacist assassination force youve mentioned?  reminds me of clayton bigsby.,1

300,now we have it......hes white hes guilty.,1
301,Canadian communists want to regulate and kill the only growth industry in the entire country. Canada used to be a worldwide shining example of free market principles and wealth creation. Now it is a quasiMuslim socialist hell hole run by ignorant pampered metrosexuals and hostile lesbians that are Kryptonite to investment.,1
302,BS. Racist. Either the tags are good are not. Another reason to Whitesplain racial profiling. He clearly realized he fd up. Lousy Officers are everywhere. They hire Officers like this with racial bias off the street all the Time. Report them. Its 2017 Ps. He didnt even run her License...clearly he knew he fd up. White People are not comfortable with admitting Racial profiling like this. lol,1
303,Being gay I am fully aware that many Muslims consider my death by them is be a blessing upon me.,1
304,And everyone in the audience is silently wondering doesnt he know that Muslim terrorism is the issue?,1

308,Or the Chinese.....very dirty business people.,1
309,Im not gay  or black or of a religious minority or any other identifiable target group. But I do think that the union is trying to stir up trouble.,1
310,Im all for that as long as we ban Christianity and all other sky fairy daddy religions too.,1
311,Yes. He couldnt even bake them a cake from an irrational belief that this participation in an event he would not even be present at would mean his buddy JehovahAllahYahweh would frown on it. That somehow this sixdegrees of separation between himself and the icky icky gays would get some kind of taint on him.,1
312,So the White people are pissed off The actions that have pissed them off will be more detrimental to our fellow Black and poor South Africans than to anyone else. People like you are shooting themselves in the foot as well as causing starvation among millions of Allready hungry South Africans. I actually pity you.,1
313,Jews who supported Trump are as loathsome as gays like Peter Thiel or transgendered people like Caitlyn Jenner who did so. I have no use for any of them.,1
314,BLM  but only if they are killed by a white cop.,1
315,Apparently ESPN thinks the way to getting a black audience is by hiring racist black sportscasters. Frankly theyre probably right.,1
316,About Mexicans being rapists?  Or about wanting to bang Ivanka?,1
317,I find it hard to take this congresswoman clown serious she looks like a transgendered cowboygirl. What a joker,1
318,Transgender is a mental disorder. Doesnt matter if your liberal or conservative.,1

326,Im glad that the GOP controlled senate has decided to make it clear that they are just a white identity death cult. That is where their base of white supremacists is. With Sessions we have a Klansman in charge of the Justice Dept. Police will be encouraged to murder unarmed minorities and the mentally ill. Obama tried to stop that. They hate anything Obama did. The GOP just put a judge on the Supreme Court that will stop our death with dignity law. Republicans seem to enjoy watching people suffer. Ironically they remind me of the Romans watching Christians killed in the Colosseum. That counted as sport too.,1
327,I see.  You think that responsibility for the mass murders lies with liberals and muslims themselves  and not with people who constantly post hatred of muslims on social media. Of course you do.,1
328,Sports is one area women will never be able to compete with men . Women suck at sports .,1
329,Hillary Clinton is a white supremacist too by their very own standards.  She lives in an allwhite community had an exKlansman for a mentor and called blacks super predators. But I bet most of them voted for her anyway.,1
330,Here we go again. The terrorist was not a Muslim immigrant as so many fear. He was British born Muslim. The offspring of Muslim immigrants. 99 of these home grown Muslim extremists are the disenfranchised offspring of Muslim immigrants.  We will not see the true impact of the current global Muslim migration for a generation or more.,1
331,Oh surprise yet another white people are bad article from the Globe and its cast of social justice warriors.  Im really sorry that someone offended you with their pizza comment Denise.  So sorry...how badly damaged you must have been.  Glad I cut my Globe subscription.,1
332,Either there will be a political solution or there will be civil war the agenda is to ethnically cleanse white people from their countries any other reasons given for this immigration genocide is just a lie.,1
333,Muslims  the new witches of our time.,1
334,And conservative Christians are still claiming that gay people or couples who seek equal rights who merely want a baker to comply with a law are seeking special rights. If a gay baker refused a conservative Christian couple a customdesigned wedding cake churches would be howling,1
335,Maybe they should pray for their pedophile Catholic priests to stop sexually molesting innocent little boys.,1
336,I can say Orthodox Jews  I can also say Sharia law burka honor killings Assad soldiers raping women Isis raping women,1

340,whites need to be expunged,1
341,Sorry Alexandea any group that denies science and wants to trample over the constitutions freedom of religion for all religions is wrong. There are many beliefs in evangelicals faith as well as Catholics faith that are plain stupid,1
342,At least I am not Rachel Dolzeal type appropriating an Indian name to covered for your liberal whiteness. There is nothing to address when you are dealing with someone who just like to type for typing sakes making it worst that anything you write is full of donkeys waste. My apologizes too all the donkeys in the world for that politically insensitive comments,1
343,Why thirdworld countries are poor? Because of crusaders white supremacists colonization etc? No because of flagrant stupidity of their populations. Considering stupidity and corruptibility of Ontarian sorry socalled elite Ontario has every opportunity to become a strong thirdworld country.,1

347,To all you mr. Kahn lovers. Your head is in the sand. Heres the anology... Its like being on a gay male beach your head is in the sand and your butt is exposed. Your going to get it from behind weather you like it or not.,1
348,Blacks are killing blacks at record numbers vs. crime against blacks by other races. This is all BS because blacks refuse to take responsibility for their own savagery.,1

350,Yup islam has active commands to kill its enemies.,1
351,These are economic migrants but of course they will tell you they are gay political dissidents escaping persecution.,1
352,News flash: Marijuana is legal but they are still selling it on the streets. Do you want it to b legal for street sale as well?  Another reminder: its not necessary to bring up the race card every single time you post. From viewing the video I believe everyone involved here was white except one black cop. Cop of color?,1

357,It wont stop till the dinosaurs in the Vatican change the  Catholic Catechism.   There are many stupid and untrue non biblical based things in there that were aimed to hate Gays and Lesbians. It is this that the bullying gets its fuel.,1

359,Maybe a major reason that Blacks viewed you suspiciously is the fruit of decades of progressives encouraging Blacks to look at Whites suspiciously.,1
360,People cant create a chaotic situation and then act innocent when a helicopter needs to be called in.  The protestors had a legal permit to be there.  Lobbing concrete filled bottles and assaulting people is not a way to deal with uncomfortable opinions.  Some selfreflection is required from everyone involved  not just evil white nationalists.,1
361,Obviously not a very good terrorist.  19 were injuredkilled.  How many were killed or injured in the Las Vegas attack?  Be thankful Muslims do not have the kill mentality like good ole white boys.,1
362,Maybe it would be better if muslims stayed in muslim countrys?  Not sure why muslims believe they can go to western countries then teach their kids to commit terrorist acts against those same western countries.,1
363,Islamic counts on Christians in the last two years  few hundred.  Civilians killing Muslims less than a handful.,1
364,Mysogyny is OK for liberals against conservative women.  For example pointing out Hillary Clintons lies was mysogynist.  But ridiculing Conway on her makeup dress etc. is OK with liberals including liberal women.  The country has woken up to the Dems and liberals hypocritical modus operandi.,1
365,Is it really surprising that white men of that era were racist? Probably hard to find one that wasnt :,1
366,Lets be really clear here:  these monuments are monuments to Jim Crow the period in which they were erected with the message of subjugation to Blacks.  Do you really think that message should be perpetuated in front of courthouses in the United States?  Because thats what the fascists are fighting for.,1
367,1 because of Islam which is an all or nothing fight to the death philosophy 2  because of Islam which is an all or nothing fight to the death philosophy,1
368,Nobody is refusing to serve blacks the blind Christians or gay people. This is what fake news is all about. The florist in this case serves gay people all the time.,1
369,Because white folks dont count.,1
370,Racism and hypocrisy at its finest. Its always racist unless they are white.  Its Islamaphobia if we want to stop people who we know want to kill US citizens. But Rooskies are white so go ahead and discriminate and fear them.  Stop rooskiephobia,1
371,You must really enjoy protecting white supremacists. Does your group have a name?,1

373,You John Titior and several others here should stop taking foreign visitor visas looking for children to have sex with. Studies show 85percent of child sex perpetrators using tourist visas to Latin America are white men.,1
374,North Korea is so stupid. They could choose to become an open society producing world class products employing their people and being an economic powerhouse serving as a conduit between communist China and Russia and the Asian Free World.........but instead their leaders all have little man just like Putin and Trump syndrome and choose to  enslave themselves and their own people.   Its just disgusting and barbaric.  A step back on the evolutionary ladder folks.,1
375,This would not be a story if she was ugly or black. Especially if she was both.,1
376,Clinton and the leftist have nothing left but the constant false narrative of racism.  Whats new?  If you hate the white majority like they do and want to reduce the white population that is what you do,1

378,Palestinians are dyedinthewool Jew haters. How dare the UN or anyone defend them in their ongoing attacks on innocent Israelis.,1
379,BLMbullies.  Where are BLM when blacks kill blacks? Where was BLM when the black female police officer was shot and killed by a black man in Florida?,1
380,The arc of xenophobic terror  whether inspired by the Islamic State or white supremacists  has recently increased in frequency and breadth. Within the past month alone Flint Portland suburban Virginia London Manchester Brussels and Paris have all witnessed acts of violence intended to maim kill and sow division.  I applaud Khan for acknowledging that James Hodgkins the Virginia shooter is a terrorist something others have been hesitant to do.,1
381,I consider a large portion of the Muslims to be  barbarians. I also consider the Mexican gangs MS13 to be barbarians.,1
382,Whites had no problem enslaving blacks.,1

390,Islam needs to be declared a terrorist organization then they will not fall under the 1st amendment.  Of course there are some good Muslims but the risk factors are too great to allow this so called religion to go unchecked.  Japan bars Muslims and the Koran.,1
391,Another case of black at the wrong time.,1
392,He was running for President of Indonesia.  A lot of white Christians wanted Obamas head too. For being a Muslim African with a fake American citizenship.,1
393,If  surveys are correct that at least 20 of priests are gay then it would follow that rape of boys would only be 20 of the total number of rapes by priests.     But the rape of boys by priests isnt 20.    Its 80.   Since the 1950s 80 of the cases of child rape by priests were same sex attacks.  This can only mean that gay priests are far more likely to sexual predators of young people.   Heterosexually oriented priests as a group tend to be far less a risk to children.,1
394,Eastman claimed that at West Point he was subjected to speeches by gay cannibals.,1
395,Imagine if it had been black people instead white rednecks.,1
396,I would like to attend a gay white supremacist wedding just out of curiosity.  So..you think its impossible for a homosexual to be racist? You dont get out much..do you? The Little Guy,1

405,Oh yeah you gotta watch out for those cut throat Christian suicide bombers.,1
406,Is racial injustice the black on black crime so rampant in Chicago?  Is racial injustice twice voting for a black president?,1
407,He is predator. Female is idiot.,1
408,If there is in fact any measurable phenomenon in Canada known as Islamophobia.  Objecting to some manifestations of Islam is not Islamophobia:  its prudence.,1
409,Id like to personally thank 53 of the white women out there for giving me the green light to treat you like a piece of meat. I used to be a very respectful gentle man who was raised correctly by a woman. Not anymore. Time to ramp up the misogynistic undertones and sexually aggressive behavior because thats what white women want apparently. And theyll let me do it too because Im a star.,1
410,Spoken like a true white supremacist.,1
411,Well a black law professor got elected president.  Now weve elected a white ignoramus.  Im not sure what that tells us.  Discuss.,1
412,How about just send all the Muslims to Muslim countries....and leave the rest of us the F alone?,1
413,Lynchings continued until the 1950s as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like disputing with a white man.  A much smaller number of whites were lynched as well often for taking the side of a black person. I rest my case.,1
414,Overqualified cause hes black and hispanic. Guess if he was gay and  trans he would really be a shoo in.,1
415,The only time your god is mentioned is when your gods revised and bastardized bible is quoted as a legal basis to steal more resources and lands from the Natives,1

417,Yes but blacks are only 17 of the population... And commit more violent crimes then whites who are about 65 of the population.,1
418,Americans know something Canadians dont. No one really wants to look at a Muslim woman.,1
419,So Trump is not a white supremacist and he is not surrounded by white men? How dare that uppity african american woman state that.I think I speak for many when I say that opinions on sports shows are best delivered by white men with puffy red laces.,1
420,Blacks in America are just people like everybody else and have the right to vote Republican. Many Black voters voted for Trump because he was the only one who was willing to discuss problems within the black communities of America.  A Black person in America has a 3 chance of being shot by police. Already this year in Chicago over 800 blacks have been shot by other black citizens. Nobody but Trump wants to talk about it.,1
421,Why isnt Justin Trudeau also being vilified as a KKK fascist Nazi?  During Pride Parade BLM called Justin a white racist so it must be true. The Globe believes everything they say  Will the Globe please turn its attention to our own fascist in office?,1
422,And lastly before you white guys get off on other wrong headed stereotypical BS lets not forget studies and law enforcement data shows it is you guys who hold the blue ribbon for raping and killing children.,1
423,No muslims or illegals in our country period. Pack up the buse are waiting.,1
424,Now that the majority of drug addicts are rural white people the solution is not mass incarceration. Other than race and location what is the difference? I guess Republicans are starting to change their mind on just saying no to drugs now that their voters are effected personally.,1
425,Can we agree that radical Islamic terrorists are evil and a threat to America?  Barack Hussein Obama cant even speak the term and we have to wonder why.,1
426,Im a Muslim a woman an immigrant and a very foolish person...,1
427,Mexican and Muslim terrorists.  Get it straight.,1
428,Surprising to hear this from Benedict i.e. the Pope.  Benedict is still alive and pontificating.  The Devil infiltrated the Church in the 1960s the priesthood is dominated by homosexuals and the false Pope is destroying the Church from within.  So sad.,1
429,she is another one of them  nasty hooked nose jew fcks like so many in the media.. we need to expose these nasty jews for what they are.. and purge them from the media altogether.. they are the liars and anti american scum that has tried to turn USA in to a bankrupt cease pool,1
430,Really how can anyone disconnect terrorism from Islam when tens of thousands of muslims around the world have joined ISIS alqaida...or just commit lonewolf violence in the name of Islam.,1
431,Antieverything but Muslim hate has been in Islam for 1000 years Christianity got that out of its system a long time ago.,1
432,Forget Gods promises. The defeat of Arab armies in their quest of eliminating Jews and Israel from the region adequately justifies ownership of land.,1
433,You cant be a white supremacistnationalist neo nazi or whatever these turds want to be called and vote for anyone but Trump. They look up to him as a savior.,1
434,ya you are right whites are corrupt and make money easily.,1
435,I dont agree that they drive American was but I do believe they are the source of a lot of trouble in this country.  most jews are crazy liberals and are constantly trying to be in control to achieve this.,1
436,hey black if there were any wrongdoing or a criminal act steps would have been taken against the offender but none was taken.  so thinking clearly there was nothing of any consequence.  making a mountain out of a molehill?,1
437,This is a tired dialogue that serves no purpose except for providing soap boxes to the writers. A winging atheist is as tiresome as a winging Christian.  Whatever you believe is a private affair and I dont want to listen read or be subjected to the reasons why.,1
438,Rotten two weeks is an understatement just like pretending hes respected. In Germany he said Canadians are more messy because we have French and Latino blood identity politics and that new immigrants were more Canadian than those born here. Then of course there is the lie that Khadr would have won more money and then protecting his blood money from the widow. Jr. is a half witted anti Canadian waste of skin.,1
439,I dont see Christians in the Islamic world blowing themselves up and murdering Muslims in the process.,1
440,Why is President Barack Obama the worst president twosail?  Because hes black?,1
441,Talk about dumb womenthey were supposed to get organized and march BEFORE the election  rather than cry like sore losers after its over .  The funny part is millions of women voted for Trump  and helped him become or 45 th president.   Adding to the dumbness  in D.C. the organizers there told all women who are pro life to not show up .  They are excluding their own sisters because they dont like theyre position on abortion. How pathetic is that ?  All those who march in D.C. support killing the nearly born through abortion. Talk about a sick group .The bottom line is these marches will mean nothing . Locally this march will mean even less.  All these women would be better off to hold a bake sale and give all the money to Planned Parenthood whos about to lose all federal funding. They could also use the money to buy birth control so they dont have to kill the innocent nearly born in the first place.  Marches like this make women look second class uninformed and like losers.,1
442,Besides white males what other visible minority would it be acceptable to vilify openly and exuberantly as Renzetti has done here?,1
443,To all of you women marching against Trump I have a question for you.  What about the killing of Muslim women by a horrible patriarchal middle eastern religion and society??? Women and girls are rocked tortured mutilated raped and burnt.  And you are protesting against TRUMP  WTF IS YOUR PROBLEM  Why arent you rioting for Muslim women?  If you are so concerned which we know you are not why arent you rioting for them?  Again  What have you done to save Muslim women from death by Husband or men? The real question is  Why dont you focus on more important things like saving Muslim womens lives Or maybe the idea doesnt fit on your Facebook page with your Madonna selfie.  In truth you women are the phonies  not Trump You are pathetic micro minority of women You do not represent women  you represent the jobs you and your husbands will lose under Trump. Thank god we are rid of you. To think we lived under your tyranny this long.,1
444,No the past is not the past because racism has been perpetuated from generation to generation of those whites who stereotype those with darker skin.,1
445,Hey Shaista Brexit is all about keeping Muslims out of Britain. Hey Shaista the middle east is all about Muslims hating other Muslims Muslims hating non Muslims lets keep it there.,1
446,They were all White Idiots  who are making America Great Again. LOL,1
447,Arthur Snooker Furtherright: I thought Americans were ignorant but Canadians rooting for this person scary,1
448,For some reason reading your post brings to mind Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov. He recently denied a persecution of gay men in Chechnya which included torturing and even killing gays. His incontrovertible evidence? There are no gays in Chechnya,1
449,Islam better known as the seventh century death cult must be snuffed out. Unfortunately we have a spineless President who is either sympathetic to the cause or just plan ignorant.,1
450,I just dont get the idea of an American coming to the aid of a Muslim. I dont even want to be in the same train car as someone wearing a hijab. I gotta say that.  And as others have said playing hero with a wacky criminal unless your life or that of your family etc. is in danger is dumb.,1
451,There needs to be away to remove these Judges from office who fail to see the light as far as protecting Americans from the savages from these Muslim countries....period...,1
452,White people are not the only ones who are racists.,1
453,Why would the right abandon Moore after these allegations?  The fact that that Moore wants to imprison gay people was fine with the right.  They are repulsive.,1
454,I missed that part of his speech where he used the three words he blasted President Obama for not using please point me to the time in the speech where he directly used the term Radical Islamic Terrorists.  Thanks :,1
455,Its no more than burning and looting done by the same oppressed blacks.,1
456,He was an excellent marksman. Was he Muslim? I hope otherwise we cannot blame them.,1
457,Segregation was wrong when it was forced by white people and I believe it is still wrong when it is requested by black people. Coretta Scott King,1
458,There is no altleft or antifa. There are fascists Nazis KKK and there are decent human beings. Every decent human being is opposed to fascism. You could just as easily call them people. Nazis and white supremacists are subhuman.,1
459,Funny when I make comments about angry white males Im supposed to be ashamed of my sexist language.  I have a feeling some broflakes really love their double standards. Women belong in the dentists office because tee hee but when a woman makes a statement about men and how they behave because testosterone? Interesting.,1
460,What i take away is dont give women a bottle and a keyboard. This explains a lot of the comments on this website,1
461,If these measure make us less safe now that only means we were not safe before.  If this causes Muslims to harm us now  it only means they wanted to harm us before. Nothing changes except it exposes the treachery of the people who tell  us we have nothing to fear.,1
462,Islam is a dark sinister force and for some reason the left continues to turn a blind eye to this .,1
463,There is nothing to heal as I see it. A disgusting filthy P I G has been elected president and there are plenty of uneducated whites that are proud they voted for this P I G. I personally dont have time for disgusting P I G S or uneducated whites who vote for P I G S.,1
464,For the love of God do NOT let this scumbag on our campus  Stay out of our city  You nor any of these dumbass inbred whitetrash supremacists are wanted  YOU ARE NOT WELCOME,1
465,Interesting how this cosmic Jewish zombie keeps our kids from killing each other.,1
466,While Muslims excoriate us about supposed Islamophobia we should bear in mind Islams entrenched xenophobia homophobia misogyny antisemitism  Christophbia Europhobia Americanophobia iconoclasm and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal  wars of extermination between Kurds Shiite Sunni Wahhabi Druze and other Islamic sects are the cause of all the civil war and genocide going on all across the Muslim world. Its worse than anything expressed in the west even by Trump,1
467,Lefties are stupid then... because crazy people dont ever get an AR and shoot up San Bernardino or gay nightclubs...  which makes me wonder why are these shooters always LIBERALS?  Grow up.,1
468,Ramadan  a good excuse to execute ur Christian neighbours,1
469,You are minimizing a fascistracist event in history That  means you are a supporter of racism. You are probably a White male republican I presume ?,1
470,Me too Neko.  Good Lord the gay brings out the worst in some TradCaths understanding of Christianity.  And yes I am definitely making a distinction between Christians and self proclaimed traditional catholics.,1
471,strong stated desire to kill people in the name of Islamic State That is the important part.,1
472,They censored nigger? You make a quote that blacks are not persecuted for saying n1 gger and it is overwritten? I  had black a UO basketball players say to me what up my nigger as he came off the court for half time. It just struck me as funny and definitely not racist or worthy of uproar.,1
473,Well you know as long as they are not white everything should be fine.,1
474,Careful there Kurgan you might be calling for the elimination of homosexual priests from the Church.,1
475,While considering the misfortune of this woman and her family consider that experts say illegal immigration to the United States in recent decades has tended to depress both wages and employment rates for lowskilled American citizens a disproportionate number of whom are black men.,1
476,Most of us had no choice these ungrateful Muslim refugees were shoved down our throats for photo ops by bleeding heart Liberals,1
477,Muslims do not assimilate. Muslims infiltrate. It is called Hijrah jihad by immigration.,1
478,I know it makes you feel good like a white supremacist should but the truth is youre descended from the same monkey as the rest of us.,1
479,A Muslim from Montreal tried to kill security office in Flint Michigan. Where is that story?,1
480,Homosexual Leftists...like Larry Craig Denny Hastert and Mark Foley..???,1
481,That wouldnt make the English xenophobes happy. Those guys would probably like to leave the Commonwealth if it would stop all those pesky darkies and Muslims from getting in.,1
482,Statistically the victim would be a young black male shot by the same.,1
483,So when you granddaughter gets raped by a Muslim kid with no hope for the future because his familys welfare ran what then?  Stand up or go away,1
484,I agree with you the white lefties globalists are the most hypocritical humans of them all. They are the cancer of the white race Being racist doesnt mean to be cruel to other races.When a black woman told me that with 10 whites left on earth in 2016 there were 9 too many.Now  that is not racism but cruelty.,1
485,By disappearing you are F..ing your country how can we trust these bastards to be loyal to us? no more muslim terrorist in our country,1
486,Im sad to say that Im not surprised. I just say no however to brown white supremacists with ethnic origins.,1
487,Do NOT list the islamic psychos in with decent people with mental illnesses... that is a very grotesque statement,1
488,I would trust any transgendered soldier to have my back before I would trust Trump or any of his biblethumping christian bigots.,1
489,Transgenderism is a guaranteed way of getting some attention when a youngster gets none at home.,1
490,I wonder whether Trudeau is sending the GG so that the Liberals can avoid backlash from their jewish donors and muslim voters.  By sending the GG Trudeau can absolve himself of personal responsibility if it fails or take the  credit if it works.,1
491,Charles have you shot your limit on racist pigs yet?   Instead of celebrating the death of a black man we now celebrate the death of whiteys.  After all we have to get our revenge do we not?   Have you disowned Nelson Mandela yet because he would not let black South Africans get revenge on whitey?,1
492,The opioid and heroin epidemic finally gets some attention since it beginning to have a huge impact on rural middleaged white men?  Well at least hopefully something will be done since it is a huge problem.,1
493,The Sultan of Oman is gay and had ruled for 50 odd years.,1
494,I wish Congress cared as much about our domestic racist terrorists as they do about Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately those folks are part of the GOP base. Trump and the Republicans need every one of the white racist voters to show up and vote.  Unintended consequences of this legislation could have very negative out comes for the nation. We have military bases in more than 100 countries and we have killed people in most of those countries.,1
495,Right. Thousands cheered when Trump called Mexicans drug dealers and rapists they also cheered when he called for banning Muslims from this country and having mosques placed under surveillance. That is nativism.,1
496,Very well said. Ill just add that considering the new utopia for the left is equality how come there are subsets which are more equal than others such as natives blacks muslims LGBTQ etc. They claim equality for all but are hypocrites of the highest kind promoting their pet groups above other human beings.,1
497,Is everyone here really that ignorant about the kind of fanatical extremist religious sect the Nation of islam is? No they just choose to ignore it and rail on Christians for things that happened a thousand years ago because its the hip thing to do.  Btw Im not a Christian.,1
498,so it was a good thing that the US and Canada rejected that ship of jewish refugees back in the 1940s??,1
499,Republicans are such predictable hypocrites. You can safely bet that whatever they are obsessed with and accusing the other side of doing is what they are actually doing.  private emails? check. Take Rep. Tim Murphy RPA for example. Rep. Murphy is a fine upstanding Republican with a wife and a mistress. Good redblooded guy who is now implicated in his girlfriends divorce. In texts produced in connection with court proceedings a possible pregnancy became something to manage when Murphy and his lady friend Shannon Edwards thought she might be pregnant. And you have zero issue posting your prolife stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week Shannon Edwards wrote. Murphy answered her writing I get what you say about my March for life messages. Ive never written them. Staff does them. I read them and winced. I told staff dont write any more. I will. How long can it be before we find out McConnell is transgender?,1
500,LISTEN loser islam apologist your evil so called religion is murdering people around the world daily it is the problem period,1
501,Of course you can prove your legality....your whiteness is proof that you are human  while dark complexion is proof of subhuman,1
502,This is what happens when you allow Islam in your countryterrible,1
503,The internment camps for the Japanese are a good precedent for things we really shouldnt be doing. We need to take a hard look at this antiMuslim business and see who is behind the curtain pulling the levers.,1
504,As I said if the Nazis and White Supremacists had their way no other colors would be left. Are you so nave to think that a day of marching would satisfy their appetite for blood and destruction? Do you think that they would idly stand by six days a week when all the groups they hate marches on? Their day of rest will only come after they killed off all they hate.,1
505,Oh....I almost forgot the law that states only white people and the Government are allowed to control land they own or charge for using it....silly me.,1
506,For your information the FBI investigates hate groups and hate crimes. In this nation.  Any other criminal activities that you claim may have occurred during the riot are investigated by local law enforcement.  I think I have an answer for you though after the woman was killed by a white supremacist who ran his car over her the mayor got of TV and told the Nazi lovers many from out of state  to get out of his city now.,1
507,A tricky issue. Past homosexuals are pretty much all dead of AIDS. And they have no descendants so who do you apologize to?,1
508,men have tolerated misandry for decades. this cultural revolution has led to broken homes crazy people and poverty. so while i may find some guys remarks unpalatable i have had to tolerate a bunch of nasty talk from women directed towards men including my wonderful dad and sons for years. so dont call the kettle black ladies. you are just as despicable. and amoral.,1
509,The anti racists are racists themselves they hate white people but do their hating under the guise of equality.,1
510,millionaire blacks are no closer  to the suffering in the ghetto than you or I,1
511,The American people are by and large PIGS.  They need the stink of the systemic racism of this st nation rubbed under their noses at every opportunity.   And think about it we embrace this game where desperate men maim themselves for our enjoyment.  What a classy country.,1
512,Becoming religious does not make you violent but going to Afghanistan and becoming religious can. When in Afghanistan and seeing grown men have sex with young boys and goats after maghrib its pretty difficult not to judge.  When their prophet and founder Mohammed married a 6 year old and was screwing her by 10 years of age respect is hard to come by I dont like pedophiles. Verses in the Quran call for violence against all who do not believe in Allah.  I know good people exist who practice Islam but the radical Muslims are like an ever spreading stage 4 cancer.,1
513,Again its a made up word by the white supremacists. And has no known group. Words have meanings.,1
514,Islamic terrorism is the ultimate right wing cause. Both extremes have their dangerous fanatics and neither extreme is free of sin.,1

517,I am superior to all white racist bigots.,1

He admitted earlier in his career to using campaign money to pay off debts and his mortgage which is not illegal but unethical. He tried to sign a law in Indiana that would make it okay to refuse any service to gay people and also to allow employers to fire people because they are gay. What rock did they find this guy under. Cannot be in a room with women if wife isnt present. Its a good thing for him he is under the thumb of the Koch Brothers.,1
521,Unless priests and lay eucharistic ministers in this bishops diocese are cut from an entirely different cloth from priests and lay eucharistic ministers that I know in a handful of US dioceses the actual response to his guidelines among many of them will be Oh yes yes of course .

537,Black people are so selfish and greedy.  Slavery has already been eliminated...but somehow thats not enough  They want to also erase our memories of that greater time when we still had slavery.

584,i dont know if i should be happy or sad that im white trash. regardless as a white male Ill still be accused of being privileged,1
585,You have the disgraceful temerity to draw a moral equivalence between the Holocaust and the Jewish recovery miracle and the Palestinian fourth generation UN titsucking Jewhating refugee bullshit story. Its exceedingly charitable to describe you as a libtard.,1
586,Wrong  They traded with the Muslims or it was a war prize.  You didnt even read the article.  What they found means nothing.  The Vikings were not Muslim.  Just more propaganda by the Communists on the left so they can tear apart the white mans culture.,1

590,no doubt but what good does only my understanding do if the races commitin the crimes wont bother trying to understand and work either? you think Im racist and to a degree ill give you credit but it is only because of the black people Ive met and known.

Of you read real history you might know that.  Most slaves after being captured by black Africans and sold to white slave traders were sent to South America Central America and the islands in the Caribbean.  Approximately 2 were sent to North America.  Those are facts not left wing progressive propaganda.,1
602,The nonwhite groups all play ethnic politics. I dont think theyre going to like it when we get serious on the same level.,1
603,Thats right. Only white men are allowed to be racist and sexist.   Know your place Robin H.,1

605,Why do I have dreams of killing the fake Jews that run Israel???????,1

617,Karem is a fag,1
618,You have to dig deep into Christian lore to come up with an example like that. Most Christians have transcended the silly stage of their religion many Muslims appear not to.,1
619,The only snowflakes I see are the insecure white supremacists and the Nazi pansies.,1
620,exactly far too many Self Loathing White Liberals in this paper.  They will screw up this country so badly it will take generations to take it back,1
621,trump should single the white nationalists out  just like obama should have singled out BLM for their violence.,1
622,Apparently Imams and Muslims clerics  calling for death to Jews in Toronto is nothing to get upset about. Anybody who does take pause over such common Muslims attitudes is just a bigot  Islamophobe. Antisemitism is something only white people are guilty of because  Muslims say kill all Jews with love in their hearts.,1
623,Ask the Korean neighborhood in LA during the 1992 riots... or ask the black men in Ferguson MO protecting their white bosses convenience store during their riots if they would have preferred double barrel shotguns against angry mobs... you shouldnt be so quick to curb anyones liberties. Tomorrow it may be your turn.,1
624,I am amazed but pleased that the Globe did not censor you for saying that. Seems we are normally not allowed to state that  fact. Blacks commit crimes against Cops way more than the reverse,1

632,Yes suicide bombings are all the Wests fault How does he explain Muslims killing Muslims? ISIL has probably killed more Muslims then Westerners. He appears to be a leftwing ninnie.,1
633,We will see women as popes  when Islamic men stop raping women playing tahharush killing gays forcing them to cover up not allowing them to drive stop performing genital mutilation etc. Jk we know neither will ever happen. Now run along and make my white self a sandwich honey,1
634,why is this even being discussed? because the lying liberal media hates Trump republicans conservatives and caucasian males.,1
635,more whites are killed by cops actually. its just that relative to population  blacks are killed at a higher rate. maybe its because blacks commit way more crime than whites per capita.,1
636,... White folks refuse to do those jobs anyway ...   As a teenager I spent many long hot hours in farmers fields laboring under the sun for minimum wage with quite a few other white kids.    Your viewpoints are extremely onesided and parochial.,1
637,Anyone well educated that has any intellectually honesty will not be voting for Hillary.  Given the choice between a businessman with a rodent on his head the unqualified and racist tags are nothing more than regurgitated media lines and a liar who cant be trusted give me the business person.  Trust the polls not just yet.  The white trash inbreed thing wow.,1
638,When black people started to insist that they be allowed to sit in the front of the bus to go to white schools and to be served at white restaurants some white people were bored.  Stephen J. Remington,1
639,Muslims are killing Muslims.  Their war has been ongoing for over 1400 years.  Why is the west getting involved?  Let them kill each other if that is what they want to do.  After all neither side is suing for peace.,1
640,Mateen killed those 50 gay people and shot  another 50 for the glory of Allah.,1
641,Fabers writing Thank God white people populated America and not the blacks is not like someone using the perfectly good word niggardly  not even a little bit. One is a racist comment the other merely sounds like it but isnt.,1
642,In essence hockey is a sport played by white folks for white folks and Canadas white folks mostly still deny there are racial prejudices in the country: they might think they see it but they dont and they certainly dont get it.  The Penguins and the NHL are simply willfully blind to the society around them.,1
643,You declare that homosexual acts are immoral and evil.  I declare that you are evil for trying to devastate a group of people just for being who they are.  So whose declaration should carry greater weight?,1
644,So you use sexist quotes to make an argument that there isnt sexism in science and you apparently agree that women are lesser scientists.  You even selfexcluded yourself because youre too emotional according to your other post.  Its pathetic when women act in the service of male superiority.,1
645,Eliminate religion in publicly funded schools period.  Including Catholic.  Including Muslim prayers.,1
646,The whole ridiculousness of Transgender Sex is obviously here,1

649,Why can Muslims not stay in Muslim countries?,1
650,Great. Catholics are on the winning side and the country as a whole loses. Whats not to love? Make America hate again.,1
651,I happen to pay attention to the kind of political correctness ruling Europe nowadays. Insults verbal attacks derision calling anyone a Nazi antisemitic heartless bigot who objects to the mass migrant and mostly Islamic invasion and the concomitant and deliberate destruction  of European white culture religion and values. Whites are becoming an endangered species.,1
652,Sure it would be incestuous so?  See if you argue that homosexual sodomy should not be repulsive then you cannot NOT argue that incest is not repulsive.    As the Ancient Greeks pederasty culture teaches us homosexual acts are a function of culture not innate attraction.  They are not genetic.  More homosexual men out of the closet will lead to more incidents of samesex sodomy acts and more people adopting a homosexual identity.,1
653,The dumbing down of Catholicism.  Next ......,1
654,Arrest  his mother for terrorism too for brainwashing her child to believe that jihadi war is a holy duty that he must perform.   She educated her son in the ways of killing and martyrdom. But for her he would have gone to school. She is hardly a third party bystander to this whole affair.,1

656,freeheels  Its the racismmass murders by radical muslimswelfare to able body personsetc etc  where do you livein a vacuum??,1
657,Nice job to deflect and distract just like your mindless leader. Do you really think people fall for that? Its beyond belief the levels that Trump supporters will go. Defending a clueless unqualified president shows why Trump won the vote  because of the uneducated white males and white supremacists who dont know what theyre doing. its really sad that there are so many of those types in our country.,1
658,Sources ? How about one you lackcommon sense .   Anyone who is so twisted they cant accept the way they were born cant be trusted to be in the same bathroom with young girls. Teachers and coaches have background checks .  To you  you say transgender is not synonymous with pedophilethey are kissing cousins.,1
659,So basically some crazy White guy can just make shit up out of thin air and the DMV and courts just go right along with it. Awesome  whitepriviligematters,1
660,Hope the black lives matter is being heard by the black people who keep shooting each other in various towns.,1
661,Muslim terrorists.  Clear enough for you?  Take you head out of your ass before its too late.,1

663,Why isnt Hussein brought up on charges for cooking the books and breaking immigration laws.  Ah crap he be black,1
664,wow  can we apply that litmus test to muslims that kill in the name of their religion?  seems to me you just solved the worlds problems,1
665,STUPID NIGGERS,1
666,Can we say Islam is bad? Islam is threat to Canada? Its illegal to say such thing?   Can we discuss this topic:    if Muslim becomes majority in Canada or even 20 What kind of Canada will become?,1
667,. . .  she wants to give other women of color the training she hadnt had.   Im gonna start a class training ONLY white men how to use guns just to see how well it goes over with the press.,1
668,Ah coward why do you flag me so? I say again in reply to your racist comment: You are always free to leave. But as you know and as I know you need us more than we need you. I am sure most of us will not find comfort in Islamic prayer. Unless of course one is into genital mutilation etc etc.,1
669,And gay people dont choose their orientation either.  Maybe thats a discussion you should have with your bevy of gay friends.,1
670,Another Communist Jew.,1
671,Another day another black on white murder in Denver.  But like Hickenlooper said theres nothing going on. Its just random violence.,1
672,Any of her items are not subject to free thought just censorship by the Islamic hate commission.,1
673,are Imams stopping their preaching of the killing of Jews and Infidels?,1
674,Are you one of those who says Love your neighbor as yourself unless of course your neighbor is gay. That neighbor you should hate and fear as intrinsically disordered.,1
675,Awwww. Poor white guy.,1
676,Black lives matter is a joke when you look at statistics  and hear their argument that it is the white man oppressing them. Come on folks how many years are we going to continue this Im a minority and life isnt fair to me.

677,Black Pride  being black and proud Gay  Pride  being gay and proud White Pride  NAZI,1
678,Blacks kill far more blacks than cops.  WAY more.  Why dont the players protest that???,1
679,But Dilly reasonable people are centrists.  It most certainly is a Muslim ban.  Trump has articulated dozens of times over the past year that he wishes to ban Muslims.  If it walks like duck quacks like a duck and looks like a duck then.....its a duck.  And this is a Muslim ban.,1
680,Canadians have been duped easily I want no part of this 3rd world multicultural cesspool and genocide of white people.,1
681,Cant wait for some of this stunt outrage to be aimed at Muslim business owners once this gets pushed through.  Im sure there are plenty of Muslim restaurants who would refuse to cater a gay wedding.  Too bad the UCLA considers Muslim intolerance of homosexuals a protected civil right.,1
682,Child  please. That crap has been thoroughly debunked  you white nationalist little snowflake.,1
683,Do you have a brain if youre old white and irrelevant?,1
684,Except right wing Christians and Evangelicals dont represent the entire spectrum of the Christian faith. In fact I would call their behavior very unChristian faith is a very broad spectrum. Im sorry your personal experience caused you to turn off but rest assured that there are millions of caring unjudging Christians.,1
685,hell is evangelicals,1
686,Hmmm....also seems like that guys religious affiliation if any was not listed as a motive whatsoever.  It also seems that instance was nothing compared to the other 99.99 of terrorism which is carried out by Muslims:    URL  Of the listed 50 Terrorist Organizations 44 or 90 of them are Muslim.,1
687,Homosexuality is a biological issue and not one of ideology.,1
688,How many offcolour racist antiwhite slags by black students on campuses  go unpunished?  All of them.,1
689,I also forgot:  Make the Mexicans pay for the wall nope,1
690,I doubt very much that you chose to be heterosexual. I know that gays do not say I think I will be homosexual. It must be fun to be a member of a despised and persecuted minority.  And you are still hung up on gay sex is icky.,1
691,I guess all white conservatives are now labeled white supremacists by the liberal pathetic lying media turds and turdettes. They are disgusting.,1
692,I hate Muslim terrorists and the psychotic Muslims in ISIS. Is that allowed in your politically correct version of reality?,1
693,I think the real snowflakes are the angry white men who are afraid to loose their place on the pedestal.,1
694,Id suggest that a white person smearing black makeup on herhis face in order to impersonate a black person is already doing something however unintentional that is demeaning to black people. The white persons ignorance of hisher cultures white supremacist tradition of caricature and cultural appropriation does not change the fact of herhis participation in this tradition.,1
695,If a cartoon causes a deadly attack imagine what a series of pointed televised questions to a Muslim candidate for federal judge will cause.   Only the people who like the feeling of sand in their ears and mouth continue to play pretend on this front.  Need a qtip?,1
696,Im so confused I thought we had to ban Iranians because they were terrorists? Its almost as if the Muslim ban was just to score political points who would have thunk it?,1
697,Islam is cancer and does not belong in the western world.,1
698,It discriminates against muslims. The temporary ban is against 6 arab countries who happen to be islamic in nature. Its perfectly clear to any sane person the beheaders those who stone the women gay assassins body bombs come from this nations for those who do not comprehend these are places of grave concern for the lives of American citizens.  Russians Chinese Indians South Americans etc arent the ones causing so much distress in the world. What a hypocrisy.  So yes you need to identify the enemy Obama Trudeau dont know who the terrorists are they cant identify them. Weaklings.,1
699,It means the racists in da village dont want white trash hunting  their caribou.,1
700,It will be called another car accident soon instead of a muslim terrorist attack.,1

702,its the ideological non white males im worried about about.,1
703,Japanese is not a race.,1
704,Just as pseudo Christians pseudo conservatives have destroyed the GOP political correctness has destroyed liberalism.,1
705,Leftists like this writer are absolutely precious.  After literally thousands of attacks by Islamic barbarians in the name of Islam this guy is focused on .... more immigration  It makes a certain sense though.

The other side was objecting to this vile intrusion. If thats altLeft sign me the f up.,0
898,I agree with Mr. Wadell that all ideologies are not created equal.  He highlights some of the differences between Islam and Christianity but the most important distinction regarding ideologies is faithbased v. evidencebased.  Stone ageideologies like Islam and Christianity which are based on ridiculous unsupported fantasies have proven to be terrible for humanity.  Evidencescience based ways of knowing are far superior.   And while they dont guarantee immediate peace and prosperity they most certainly give us the best chance for it.  Thats why institutions in our society responsible for seeking the truth like the press the courts and universities use evidencebased ways of knowing and long ago left behind the great engine of ignorance and stupidity known as religion. Its depressing that so many still hold on to these very old and very destructive faithbased ideas.,0

908,Catholics who voted for Trump are getting what they deserve. Unfortunately the rest of us are going to have to suffer with them.,0
909,Ok lets use 1.  If a White person panders to Black people because of a presumed superiority of White people because of e.g. longterm effects of slavery then its racism.  See?  Bending over backwards to offset race issues is racism sometimes called reverseracism since the former is the overwhelmingly more common sort.,0

927,Nope your bible verses dont apply to illegal aliens.    Out they go,0
928,So substitute gay with colored,0
929,Change it to Jew hating crowd then you cannot evade what I mean.  What a dopey reply.  Antisemitism also spelled antiSemitism or antisemitism is hostility prejudice or discrimination against Jews. A person who holds such positions is called an antisemite.,0

933,Good job scolding the Black community.  I suspect you also scold the White community when Alaskas parade of serial killers gets mentioned Robert Hansen Israel Keyes James Dale Ritchie etc. right?,0
934,Well thats not very inclusive of Womens bathrooms  The President should decree that all Womens Restrooms receive urinals so as to be more inclusive for the gender confused who just happen to have a penis.,0
935,The Trump solution: Round up all the Samoans and Blacks lock em up and deport em.,0
936,And I among many others am furious that the media isnt calling these wouldbe killers terrorists just because they arent Muslim. They keep referring to them as militia which gives them an aura of respectability and patriotism for a lot of sad sad deluded people. They ARE terrorists and they should be referred to as such,0
937,Honestly you really are clueless EXCEPT.....some of the worst sexual assaults were in fact committed by a few Catholic priests and now....Pope Francis wants to be merciful and let them off with a slight tap on the wrist. Technically that is rape in the name of Jesus.,0

942,Im pretty sure as this blithering idiot trying for attention knows Kaepernick did not kneel for or against Trump. As usual with the black crowd they are trying to Martin Luther King an event ie glom onto a celebrity and change it to match their story.,0
943,U  Like Sucking Black C O C K,0

945,Leonard Pitts is a black supremacist,0
946,Makes perfect sense. I favor them 100 to 0. Muslims are no refugees.,0
947,This above comment is based in the Watchtower of 1969 condemning organ transplants as cannibalism now it is up to the member to decide what is the better option not with blood transfusion  still it is considered a sin and a reason to be expelled. Jehovahs Witnesses is an evil sect.,0
948,Trust me. it is no privilege being white with racists like you blaming me for everything you and your kind get wrong.,0

951,Dont worry Richard no one will ever take away your right to hate black people or gay people for having the same legal rights as you. Your bigotry and intolerance will always be protected by the US Constitution so you can feel free to be just as hateful and closeminded as you always have been.,0
952,So if they refuse to dance for a black official or a gay official you are just as approving?,0
953,Actually I have more nonwhite friends than you that agree with me  But then they are not psycho white leftist progressives who hate themselves,0
954,Yeah socialists want to exterminate Jews like that Jewish guy Bernie wants to do.  Id say the level of ignorance and lack of education is comical except its so detrimental to our country. Read a book sometime.,0
955,you think and talk about it more than most gay folks I know do.   sounds almost as if you are fantasizing about it and cant get it out of your thoughts.   LOL,0
956,This situation reminds me of the Conservative Party of Canadas opposition to a parliamentary vote condemning Islamophobia following the terrorist attack on a mosque in Quebec that killed six people.. We must condemn hatred from all sides. You know where these people are all coming from and what their intent is and their followers were blogging the same Islamophobic garbage right here on the Globe website.. They are the same as Trump.,0
957,Similarly that does not offer any clue as to how you can blame Donald Trump a supporter of gays as responsible for a man slaughtering gays. Literally makes no sense.,0
958,Women want sex with men ? Really ? Lesbians dont want sex with men  and  work very hard to train all young impressionable  women of the dangers any man poses  even if he offered her a seat on the bus. Rewording the song is an act of heterophobia.,0
959,really?  Should we kick out the Jews the Irish the Italians the Sikhs and anyone else you dont like?,0
960,What if instead of Christian Freaks your comment said Muslim Freaks?,0

964,I dont get it.  To date all Israeli Jews blackbrownwhiteSephardiAshkenazi share a single space with separation between the sexes.  What rationale is there to demand being different and have a separate section for anyone or anything?,0
965,Really? Is DM the new Huffington Post? First white men dont deserve to vote now all men are trash. Even Guptaleaks is more interesting reading material.,0
966,That definitely looks like a jug of bleach. Must have some dirty whites.,0

970,Look up Maajid Nawaz. He is trying to do exactly this but is labelled an apostate and is hated by many Muslims.,0
971,Anyone who thinks this is disrespectful needs to watch any of the myriad of videos of cops shooting black men down in the streets like dogs.  Thats fucking disrespectful.,0
972,She hates men because thats what her mother taught her.,0
973,Exactly.  Look at nursing which is a meritocracy in most countries yet there there is only 10 male in that profession.   Where are the feminists asking why there are not more men in nursing?,0
974,I wish him all the best but he first needs to 1. Win a seat and 2. Overcome a lot of racism. I honestly wouldnt be surprised if he won the NDP race purely due to the sortof viral video of that idiot woman accusing him of being a Muslim. That got him a LOT of great publicity.,0
975,Hes not from the inner city. He comes from an upper middle class family. Why would you mention inner city? Because hes black?,0
976,Kind of thick Chuck. The word faggot has long been used as a homophobic slur. Thats why Pillar used it. Just because youre apparently not aware of this use doesnt mean its not intended that way. And your gay friends use of it has absolutely nothing to do with what Pillar meant when he said it. Think of blacks and their free use of then word within their own culture.,0
977,I am thrilled to see ICE picking up criminal illegals. There are SOOOO many criminals illegals and deporting them all mommas poppas dreaminals whatever cannot go fast enough.,0
978,Unless you can account for that datum you have nothing to add to the discussion.  So go ahead and play the victimized conservative white man to your hearts content but dont expect anyone to take your opinions seriously.,0
979,No America needs resentment management.  Very useful point.  Clearly the resentment that has been building up among some whites over the last eight years has been very hard on the body politic.  Soon the black president will be gone and the whites who voted for Trump have elected a man who will Make America White Again. As soon as Trump has Made America White Again the whites who voted for him will no longer be eaten up by resentment.,0

984,Yep.  No argument.  You should try to beat it into the heads  of these other nitwits.  Like the guy who keeps claiming we Muslims are a race...,0
985,Policies of new US administration face Catholic opposition  But not the USCCB.,0
986,Like Ive been saying Trump is not a racist with a Jewish son in law convert daughter and Jewish grandchildren. Along with a black friend Dr. Ben Carson. Honesty? Who is the bigger liar Hillary or Trump? I will say Hillary.,0
987,Outsider77 : Yes...exactly.  How would you feel if you encountered a mean heavy ignorant  woman and said to a bystander OMG What a stupid fat pig.  Then you read the next day: Outsider77 Calls All Women Stupid Pigs.  Trump NEVER said that...nor did he Ever Call ALL Mexicans drug smugglers  rapists and Murderers.,0
988,You forgot several of the left talking points you hit racist good boy. You forgot homophobic Islamophobic sexist fascist and bigot. But yes it is clear that Trump jr must have taken this meeting because.....HES A RACIST,0

996,Would the transgendered adult male who now identifies as a prepubescent girl suffer from a psychological disorder in your opinion?,0
997,Please provide some sort of backup...ANY fact...that supports this statement.  AfricanAmericans are on the bottom last hired and first fired not because they dont work but because they are black.,0
998,Yes some men are scumbags.  Yes some women are scumbags.  Did anything real happen in the world while the focus of the NA press was on this story?,0
999,I am reminded of Martin Luther Kings Letter From A Birmingham Jail. I am particularly reminded of this paragraph:  We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was well timed in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word Wait It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This Wait has almost always meant Never. We must come to see with one of our distinguished jurists that justice too long delayed is justice denied.  Substitute homosexual for Negro and it rings true in this situation.,0
1000,But you hate Muslims,0
1001,Just funny that you are equating the muslims with people with disabilities. You said it. Not me.,0
1002,i cant wait for trump to clean up the country and kick out these bomb throwing jihad kooks. i understand you want them to stay and have free everything  thats nice.,0
1003,That to me is a a viciously racist statement and why I consider BLM to be racist.  If in recent times American whites in general thought black lives dont matter then whites in general would have tried killed blacks without remorse and harm them whenever possible.,0
1004,Your definition of racism is racist.   What about the feelings from darkskinned people that other races are hateful and should be destroyed?  Are they not equally racist?,0
1005,You got owned charles.  You assumed Mekun is white and that makes you a racist.,0
1006,stallion security guard companies is killing blacks especially youths in school uniform in johannesburg and this man  was a majority shareholder.when this was brought to his attention he disinvested and never asked the police minister to investigate.they are partners with these antiblack ompanies.,0

1019,"On the contrary: according to Jewish tradition, giving money to the poor and to others in need is not just encouraged, it is required. The Hebrew word tzedakah is often mistranslated as “charity,” which itself comes from the Latin word “caritas” or heart. One gives charity “from the heart,” that is, out of a desire to give. Instead the translation of tzedakah should be “righteousness,” implying that giving to the poors is the right thing to do, whether one wishes to give or not. According to Jewish law, tzedakah is then a mitzvah, that means “commandment.” And, like all commandments in Jewish law, the mitzvah of tzedakah is a requirement, not just a good deed.",0

1212,There are of course differences among groups: unfortunately racism is the first and foremost characterizing us.,0

1529,"Your movie choice can be more the result of opinion rather than of merit. But it's ok, because it is your choice. However, it is important to be cautious: in some countries it is not even allowed to screen or promote movies with gay themes. Such a ban is contrary to our fundamental values.",0

1542,What 'we' means? Are you saying that every gay person you know should vote against you? Or do you think some of us identify as LGBT?,0
1543,"Afro-Saxon, as you call them, are great in many ways. They are proud and independent, refusing every categorization and stereotype. The fact that there are so many of them in the country proves that the feeling of belonging they have for our homeland is paramount to all other considerations.",0
1544,I find the idea that LGBT people are inherently bad people deeply offensive. I find it deeply troubling that someone would want to persecute someone on the basis of their sexual orientation.,0
1545,"They are not subhuman, they are just people with different sexual orientations.",0
1546,"If a person is a Muslim, it does not mean they are incapable of caring for their children. What does it mean to be a ""real"" parent?",0
1547,WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.,0

1553,Women should be treated as equal in life.,0
1554,We should not be so judgmental. Just because someone is LGBT doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. They are like any other member of our community.,0
1555,You would be surprised how many feminists are very good at convincing people that changing a misogynistic and violent world is not against the interests of men.,0
1556,I think we all know that's not true. I've met countless black people who were nice to me and treated me with respect. What is the evidence for what you're saying?,0

1558,"Many Gypsies have regular jobs, but we do not know, because they don't need to tell.",0
1559,"I wouldn't say that ""women like bad men"". What I would like to see is a man that is interested in a woman, respectful of women, and offers her more than an exchange of sexual favors. It would be nice if men had more respectful characteristics than sexual desire alone.",0

1581,Feminism is not a religion and it is not aimed at oppressing any group. It is instead aimed at empowering women to have the same rights as men.,0

1591,"Women are people with dignity, and they deserve respect and protection, just like anybody else.",0

1597,For many Gypsies a nomadic life is a matter of necessity rather than culture.,0
1598,"Norman Cohn, a distinguished historian, ruthlessly analyzed the similaritiese between the 'Protocols' and ""Dialogue in Hell"" by Maurice Joly. It would be hard for anyone who has read that analysis to deny that ""The Protocols"" is an almost verbatim copy of the book from the French writer, or to sue a contemporary analogly, an example of 'fake news'.",0

1600,"I think transgender people should be accepted on the same basis as anyone else, they are just less comfortable with the gender they were assigned at birth.",0

1603,"You may be living in a society of imbeciles, but this doesn't give you the right to criticise all Muslims.",0

1613,"Research clearly shows that women are more emotionally expressive (because of culture influence) but not that they experience more emotions. Both men and women can feel the same way about things - whether it be a romantic relationship, a significant other, an argument, or anything else - that can provoke a feeling of fear or anger in the “emotionally unavailable” part of the brain. That is why emotion overrides everything, regardless of gender.",0

1615,I can't see how it is possible that foreign nationals raped more than ten times as many women as US citizens. It's simply impossible.,0
1616,"I have no idea what you are talking about. What you are saying is that all the immigrants in the US are a danger to society, which seems a little exaggerated...",0
1617,I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.,0

1623,"There is a problem with Islam and English society, but it is not about Islam, it is about the unjustified fear and hate towards other religions.",0
1624,"How can you blame an entire religion for all problems in the world? Look at the list of causes of death in the World Health Organisation. Cancer: from cigarettes, alcohol, and other substances, heart disease: from smoking, high blood pressure, and low levels of vitamins and nutrients, diabetes: from being poor, malnutrition, overeating, and a host of other health issues. Over the last hundred years, the number of deaths from cancer has almost doubled to 2.4 billion... Should I go on?",0

1636,To say that they have a stranglehold is not much different than to speak against minorities that in the past have been persecuted.,0

1642,So many similarities between Jews and apes? What is wrong with them? Is it because of their religion?,0
1643,Refugees are a part of our society. We have welcomed many of them and they have made a big contribution to our country. We are very proud of our history. We are not going to forget that.,0

1647,Would you say the same thing about any group of people you dislike?,0
1648,"Do you know where your information came from, and can you point that out? Did you read that in a New York Times article? Or did you listen to the BBC documentary ""Islamic State's Most Wanted""?",0
1649,Islam cannot be blamed for the actions of a small group of people.,0
1650,Muslims have contributed greatly to our country and are proud of that. They are our brothers and sisters. Why should we be afraid of a religious minority?,0

1653,"As with so many things, we all experience difficulties, this is no exception.",0
1654,"Undocumented immigrants consistently cite reasons for migrating other than the desire to have a baby here. Sensible, because any son/daughter cannot obtain a green card for the foreign parent until they are 21.",0
1655,"Noone can scientifically say that men are ""far better"" at it than women. It is just a prejudice of some people.",0
1656,Do you think Muslims are worse than the criminals who commit crimes just because of their religion?,0

1663,"When a religion, a race or an ideology rules a nation we have never had a stable, peaceful or democratic government. Not even since the fall of Rome. So how can the Jews control our nation?",0
1664,On the contrary: believing that all humans are created equal is beneficial for humanity.,0
1665,"Obama was a pretty divisive force in society too. So were Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Oppenheimer, Einstein, Caesar, etc. What is your point exactly?",0
1666,Let's face it. A lot of the crimes in this country are committed by members of several diverse racial groups. The ‘super predator’ myth is simply wrong.,0

1698,"To be honest, we are not importing criminals, we are importing people who can contribute to the community and work hard to make it a better place.",0
1699,This is just a canard that evolved from the “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”. This proven forgery was written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders where they discuss a plan to rule the world. This canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the Jews own the banks and control the media and the government.,0

1710,The rights of people with Down Syndrome to be treated fairly is something which must be respected. We cannot allow discrimination to continue to this end.,0

1732,The overwhelming majority of Muslims are not violent people. Who are you talking about then?,0
1733,What makes you think that women are jealous of men? What qualities do you value as a White Male?,0
1734,"Feminism is not a disease, nor does it need any cure. It is a movement for equality, not hate.",0
1735,"Of course not. The Jewish people have made contributions to various industries - like many other people have. That does not imply ""owing most corporation, banks, studios, etcetera"". Why should their contribution be a problem? Just because they are Jews?",0

1742,"Could I just be misinterpreting your words? You seem to me to be talking about children with animals, of zoo keepers with babies... But it might just be homophobia.",0
1743,It is not so great when people are forced to give up their liberty.,0
1744,"Women are human beings, with human rights. If a woman does not want to be dominated by a man, then what is the point of talking about equality?",0
1745,"Although there have been some cases of terrorism in the UK and some Muslim have been implicated, Islam is not a violent religion, and indeed, there have been few acts of terrorism. So banning them from the UK seems unreasonable to me.",0
1746,"Even if one were to claim that all African people are subhuman and incapable of feeling empathy, it is very difficult to prove this, since it is just a myth used for discrimination.",0
1747,"They have no intention of ruling us, why do you think this about Muslims?",0
1748,They are not nomadic by culture but due to discrimination.,0
1749,"Terrorism? You mean like every other crime, this one is committed only by Muslims? It seems that you are repeating the same unfounded claim over and over.",0
1750,"I don't see what you're saying. Feminism is about equality, and equality is about making the most of humanity.",0
1751,"A woman has every right to her own body, and she should be allowed to make her own decisions.",0
1752,How? Believing that people of a specific religion are in charge of all world's governments sounds like a conspiracy theory.,0
1753,"Since when has the Bible said that it is okay to kill gays? Are you saying you are OK with gays being executed? All people have right to life, regardless of their sexuality.",0
1754,"Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society.",0
1755,Why do you say that? The Holocaust is not less true than other historical events like the American Revolutionary War or World War II.,0
1756,"Women are human beings, and we should treat them with respect.",0
1757,Perhaps the nations that you cite are more accepting of other nationalities.,0
1758,Have you checked the records of all the gay offenders? Or do you think that those stats are completely inaccurate? Maybe you should check those before making such claims.,0
1759,"Many Jews are good people. You should try and talk to them about the terrible things that happened to them, and get to know them better.",0
1760,It is not true that lgbt+ people are incompatible with the whole of mankind. They are humans too.,0
1761,"There are hundreds of active conflicts around the world of which we have no news, and many migrants come from these areas.",0
1762,"Peace and Islam are both based on respect for other people's religions, in this case other cultures and religious beliefs. They are not opposites.",0
1763,"It seems tou don't think the law applies to those you don't like. Laws protect Muslims and non-Muslims equally , so there is no need for you to be concerned about 'protecting the security of the West'.",0
1764,"The Quran contains verses that promote peace and harmony in the world, rather than hostility and conflict. So how wouldn't it be compatible?",0
1765,"In my opinion, poverty can be as inhuman as a war.",0
1766,"Being a woman does not mean that you are submissive to others. Women can be both outspoken and placid, but it is important to respect the rights of others as human beings.",0
1767,This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? This is just hatred.,0
1768,"On the contrary, women do have rights. The question is, to have them respected. And this includes the right to be treated with human dignity.",0
1769,The religion of Islam is not a problem in our country. The real problem is the violent radicalisation of some Muslims.,0
1770,There is nothing 'petulant' about claiming your rights.,0
1771,A lot of hate directed towards Russia would they use the same yard stick for Jews Moslems and Chinese. Doubt it................,0
1772,American military slaughtered some three million folks in Southeast Asia in an illegal immoral war. You want to celebrate them for that?,0
1773,Another myopic decision made by the worlds most insufferable manchild. Impeach and jail this treasonous Russian puppet.,0
1774,Antiintellectual in over his head am I?  Yes I am sorry to tell you that I am one of the deplorable masses Hilary was referring to.    I wasnt educated at the right colleges and I cling to my guns and religion.  You know how it is with us unenlightened massesguns gays and Godor something like that.  If you dont mind I will just wallow in my own stupidity.  Thank you so much for your compassion and understanding.,0
1775,Calling two women bitches is civil and pointing out such insults is blocked as uncivil? How did insulting two women as bitches with twisted phonetics get past the civil filter? And to compound such low class behavior you like your own comment like RA used to? So much winning,0
1776,Complementarity is an attempt to rationalize current dogma.  Its  a head fake.  Again relationships are more than just sex including for gays.  Differentiating sex and sodomy is splitting hairs.,0
1777,Cone of stupidity? Seriously skewed journalism....or is Cathy now strictly an editorialist?  Obama divided the USA racially by making many ridiculous statements pointing racist fingers at police yes even black officers. Trump must be Satan....90 of pollsters and editorial writer think so.,0
1778,Cry me a river James. You sound like an old white guy here since the 1900s.,0
1779,Did this baker say gays blacks women etc. couldnt patronize his bakery?,0
1780,Diversity and multiculturalism are code words for white genocide white people are being ethnically cleansed from Canada and the fake news Globe and Mail is a big promoter of it even the picture in the article has to be a race mixing couple they love to promote the mixing to wipe out the white race.,0
1781,Elected officials swear or affirm. No stupid 2000 year old book of myths is required. Affirming the oath is all thats necessary. Your precious bible is a joke.,0
1782,HilLIARy is a bitch and Michelle O is a tranny,0
1783,How can I be black and racist assailed or white or brown or yellow WTF do you know about me azzle,0
1784,If God exists hes incredibly psychotic and schizophrenic...,0
1785,My thought as well from what Ive heard about black vs. brown behavior.,0
1786,No matter how hard the liberal bishops and Pope Francis try.  The only followers they now have are illegals home ose xuals muslims and Protestantized Catholics.,0
1787,oh please... enough of the Communist Manifesto...the stats speak for themselves...those in stir deserve to be there...black white or whatever...The United States Justice System is the fairest in the world...if you want to rant about something how about a law that makes it illegal to address a person with the wrong pronoun..you lefties are a pain in the ass.,0
1788,Perhaps it would please ADN if I said Death to America we want only Sharia Law,0
1789,practice homosexuality present deepseated homosexual tendencies or support the socalled gay culture  Since priests are celibate anyone who practices homosexuality would be automatically prohibited from Holy Orders.  Why is this even an issue?,0
1790,Quit playing the race card.  No one hates Obama because he was black.  He is hated because he was a terrible president.  His policies were HORRID.,0
1791,Sadly those who paid to be taught how to become first hand  mysogynistic racist homophobic liars will get another chance.  Drumpf will have impeached himself sooner than later and this side kick will be looking for employment opportunities all over the world  Lets keep the trash south of the border,0
1792,Sorry I meant white ethnic Catholics WI PA MI.  We supplied the votes.  As many of you may know CatholicsForTrump  led by Frank Bertoni Esq.  helped register nearly 500000 white Catholics in 5 key battleground states.  Turnout was increased by 10 over 2012 levels.    Besides moral and cultural issues CFT focused on 1 ending welfare queens ability to steal money from suburban taxpayers 2  ending racial quotas and affirmative action reverse discrimination programs 3 locking up criminals and accelerating the death penalty 4 attacking Black Lies Matter as a racist Jewhating antiCatholic ghetto criminal organization.  The Left and the media never saw it coming.   Of course not.    Wait till you see what we have planned for 2018 and 2020.  The Left is going to rue the day they bussed Irish Catholics.....closed down ItalianAmerican owned businesses.....discriminated against white ethnic Catholics....attacked religious liberty...and stole Church property for the ACLU,0
1793,The concept of Trump returning blacks to slavery was all over the internet.  It would have been very easy for a 10 year old to be exposed to this concept.  No parent or school would have had to coach a child to believe it.  You just find it hard to believe because you support Trump and followed his ignorant campaign.,0
1794,This guy is prolife so......um......this isnt the middle ages this is 2017.     Being prolife is not ok.    Does he also believe that gay people are going to burn in a lake of fire?,0
1795,What an ignorant comment.  You need to get out of your trailer park more and learn a bit about different people.  One Muslim nutjob said something to you and you are now trying to apply that to 1.3 billion others?,0
1796,Would those be the same jewish extremists who were called islamophobic for flagging the video calling for death to jews?,0
1797,Wow. More brain dead nothing burgers from left wing retards while BOTH Obongo and the HildeBEAST should be SHOT in their empty heads for arming ISIS alone.  Go figure.  Git R DONE     YES  WE  CAN     ,0
1798,You forgot to add Black Nationalist Larry,0
1799,YOU LIE. where exactly is my lie? You One Worlders are sooo messed up its not funny. Maybe he isnt broken hearted the rest is correct. How about if you want to live in a Muslim country you go to Iran instead of helping the DemoRats turn America into a similar shithole.,0
1800,"Most Jews are good people, apart from a few; I don't see how these few can be a problem to the whole world.",0
1801,"I would not say that Muslims do not have a place in a modern Western country, given the large amount of Muslims peacefully living in our societies.",0
1802,So are you saying that Islam is not compatible with Western Civilization?,0
1803,"Not all rapists are black (and not all black people are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.",0
1804,"Well, perhaps you should focus on how you can help the people with this disease, instead of random claiming that an entire minority suffers from it.",0
1805,"It seems to me that you're saying that since Jews have a different religion, they can't assimilate? I think it's important to work on inclusion, instead of stereotyping.",0
1806,We welcome people fleeing persecution. We have even taken in refugees from the war in Syria. What's the point in worrying about migrants?,0
1807,"What do you mean by ""civilised Europe""? Don't you think civilisation involves inclusion and respect for others?",0
1808,"Just for the records: Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility, not as a moral superiority.",0
1809,"You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists.",0
1810,"They are human beings who have contributed their knowledge and skills to our society. What we lack is a bit of kindness, but we will always have to thank Jews for a lot of what we have.",0
1811,"Not sure how Jewish people could ""control"" Hollywood being a minority.",0
1812,"The Quran contains references to religions from around the world and throughout history, so it is an accurate and peaceful document. It does not show a flood of violence, therefore it is not a bomb to be removed.",0
1813,"Why do you feel threatened by Muslims? Respecting others is more important than anything, in any society.",0
1814,On the contrary: more than half of American adults say they would be happy having a woman being president of the United States (roughly as many feel the same way about a man).,0
1815,"Not all terrorists are Muslims, that is an empirical fact, and your claim is just wrong.",0
1816,"There are more than two million Muslims in the UK, and Muslims are a very important part of our country for many reasons, not least because of our tradition of welcoming and supporting people of different faiths and cultures. Isn't that what has made Britain great?",0
1817,"Surely it can only be good to a family, especially if the mother is an independent woman?",0
1818,I think the idea that people are blind because they were raised by communists or whatever is a figment of the far-right's imagination.,0
1819,If we analyse the current political state of Britain at the moment it doesn't prove much about a man's ability to run the country smoothly. Politics is hard for all genders.,0
1820,"Obviously the Middle East and Africa have high birth rates, but children born in such countries are less likely to thrive, so it is our duty, written down in our values, to help them when they come here to look for shelter.",0
1821,What makes you think that? Do you have any facts to back this up?,0
1822,I am sure the Jews and the Christian worlds would agree that Ebola is a disease that is killing many people. How and why exactly would they have 'invented' such a disease?,0
1823,"People don't decide who's presenting the news. That's up to the news media, who are attempting to insert some gender equity into a world that seems to be struggling to produce it.",0
1824,"That is not true, Islam is a religion of love and compassion. Cruelty cannot be a part of that.",0
1825,Maybe we should not be so harsh on Islam. Just because a religion is diverse doesn't mean it is a violent one.,0
1826,"We should be proud of being a country that created the most free society in history. Still, ""with great power comes great responsibility"" and we cannot simply keep people out.",0
1827,"Developing a curriculum for this also means that teachers get to learn things that they might not otherwise have considered, which can make them more effective and compassionate as educators.",0
1828,Animal cruelty isn't right but it also isn't an issue concerning only Muslims. People of all faiths do it. In think it's important to rembember how in twitter a person encounters only beliefs or opinions that coincide with their own. Fake news which put Muslims under a bad light get belived and the selective media becomes impartial.,0
1829,"The suggestion that women are subhuman is completely without foundation, and a complete distortion of the whole issue.",0
1830,"On the contrary: homosexuals are an ally and supporter of freedom, civil rights, and democracy in the world. We cannot afford to lose this support.",0
1831,"Unfortunately, you are not the only one that hates homosexuals. But I would hate to think that we live in a country where it is acceptable to practice such hate.",0
1832,"If you really cared about people with mental health issues, you would be accepting them in schools. If you truly wanted to raise awareness of mental health issues, you should talk more about them, and not ban them.",0
1833,"(Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion.)",0
1834,"Still, I think we all should get to learn more about Islam, full stop.",0
1835,"Why is it that women have become more empathic than men? To me, the emotional state doesn't seem to be affected by gender.",0
1836,"It is a misconception that gay people are totally different from straight people. There are many similarities in what they seek, from love to peace, from acceptance to respect. You would learn more by talking with someone of the LGBT+ community.",0
1837,"The Muslims in our country are some of the best and the brightest, providing valuable skills and knowledge to our economy.",0
1838,Just because one religion has a large following does not make that religion a cancer. Such attempts at de-humanisation are tragic and destructive.,0
1839,"Even if you are not homophobic it does not mean it's nice to say what you said. But either way, just because a person identifies as gay, does not make you obliged to like them (or to express your disliking).",0
1840,You seem to think that women act like a child because of the things they say. Remember: anybody can be overdramatic.,0
1841,"I've never been able to find any evidence for this assertion, although it gets repeated regularly.",0
1842,Many immigrants have worked hard for the success of our country and for their integration. To suggest that they steal our jobs is just an attempt to divide society.,0
1843,The statement you made about Muslims is just fear mongering. Most Muslims are peaceful and reasonable people.,0
1844,"Many points in history are also subjects of polarized debate, but they still can be, and are, taught objectively.",0
1845,"In the UK, Muslims already make up a significant proportion of the population, making them the second most popular religion in the country. In particular, second generation Muslims are embodying the possible convergence of British culture with Islam.",0
1846,"That is called poverty. Anyway, as long as children have access to clean drinking water, food and shelter, they will be OK.",0
1847,Homosexuality has been practiced throughout history in all major civilizations. It is just that today's people accept homosexuality as normal and accept people of other backgrounds too.,0
1848,"Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are.",0
1849,"Violent people are not always Muslim, and violent Muslims exist just as violent Christians do.",0
1850,"Jewish democracy is not a lie, every nation has the right to choose its leaders, but instead of putting democracy first, we are the ones trampling the rights of others",0
1851,"I would prefer that the laws were enforced for the good of a community, rather than to make it harder for people to have religious beliefs.",0
1852,So you think of migrants and refugees as a problem for this reason?,0
1853,"Perhaps what you're saying is just hyperbole, but you seem to have a problem accepting sexual minorities in your community. Perhanps you should accept that STD is a problem of all the people regardless of their sexual identity.",0
1854,"Even in countries such as Italy, in which migration has been present for centuries and there is a lot of cultural fragmentation, there is still a strong sense of identity and culture, based on solidarity. So, migration is not an issue.",0
1855,"Well, the argument sounds like you are trying to justify racial hatred by making some generalisations. Is that the case?",0
1856,What exactly are you talking about? Maybe you should stop spread racism.,0
1857,"This is a comment made about any other so-called ""different"" group of people too. So imagine, even white Christians are different for some others.",0
1858,"People can change their minds about Islam and its believers, all it takes is enough love and acceptance.",0
1859,How about this. [insert link to Muslim group cleaning Newcastle streets after New Year's or more up to date example].,0
1860,How about you check the statistics? Foreigners represent the 13% of the prison population in the UK.,0
1861,"According to studies, the majority of immigrants are willing to do what it takes to improve their lives and ours.",0
1862,"People of colour can exist here too. We just have different skin colours. And even if we all have different origins, this doesn't mean we shouldn't all be treated equally in society.",0
1863,"The source is not reliable at all, as the webpage promote ""reorientation therapies"" whose effects hasn't been scientifically proven. The owners are likely to profit from misinformation and bad stereotypes about homosexuality.",0
1864,"According to data, more than 60% of immigrants in the United States have lived here for at least 15 years, and the vast majority has lawful status. In 2013, of the approximately 41 million immigrants in the U.S. 47% were naturalized citizens. Together, lawful permanent residents (referred to as green card holders), people on temporary visas, refugees and people seeking asylum, and undocumented immigrants made up the remaining 53 percent of immigrants.",0
1865,It's not going to do you any good to think about a Muslim massacre.,0
1866,"People of different sexualities can live openly together, even if they do not get married. Same sex relationships are recognised in a number of countries, so why should we be any different?",0
1867,"A migrant is a person, who came to this country, and has a responsibility to make our society better. People of different nationalities come to this country seeking citizenship, so their life and our country can be better.",0
1868,"Why do you think it is our duty to ""rise up"" and fight back? They are not attacking anybody.",0
1869,Removing any book from public schools would be a step backwards. Censorship is a step towards indoctrination and dictatorship: I think this is a dangerous move as well. It would send a message to our children that Islam is a dangerous religion and Muslims are dangerous people.,0
1870,"Migrants have the opportunity to work here. Even if our language is not their native one. They are contributing to our society, for example by doing unpopular jobs.",0
1871,"Of course we don't, and this is why we have a free and sovereign nation. But that doesn't mean that every single man, woman, and child who is black shouldn't be part of a free nation.",0
1872,All religions have value and should be accepted. What's the point of banning one faith?,0
1873,"What does it mean to be ""infidels""? A Muslim is someone who follows the Quran. They have a faith, and it is islamic.",0
1874,"If Jews earned so much, they would not need to work. Instead, they are working a lot. Therefore, it seems they need a job to survive.",0
1875,"It is still more difficult for women to access the labour market than it is for men. Men still out-earn women on average, by 11% in Europe. Gender discrimination isn't over yet.",0
1876,The issue of criminality is really about human nature. Individuals become criminal only when pushed. That's the difference between being a criminal and not.,0
1877,Can you think of a single example of a child being groomed by a migrant?,0
1878,"Mental ability is not the problem, but access to treatment. Having access to services or a support system is crucial. Your statement can become a source of division and hate, and people with disabilities don't deserve this.",0
1879,"Islam is a religion that has always been part of our society, and I believe that it should be part of it in the future as well. What is the problem?",0
1880,"It is a myth that only white people are allowed to be 'European'. Everyone who obtains a citizenship can be called ""European"".",0
1881,Why would you say this about a religion? Where is the evidence for what you say?,0
1882,"This is just not true. Women don't have to conform to dominant ideas on what they are supposed to be like, and this is a good thing. There is no such thing as ""what a woman should be"".",0
1883,"You mean in the same way that we should ban alcohol, tobacco, and certain medical products? Is this what you mean?",0
1884,It does not matter what their religious background is: they are all equally welcome to work at school as long as the teaching is not affected by religion.,0
1885,"They are not hating us, how many Jews do you know personally?",0
1886,The fact that people of color are different from you in some way does not make them not worth living with. Maybe if you had known someone of a different skin color you wouldn't have a racist attitude towards others.,0
1887,"I would like to see more diversity in our society, not less.",0
1888,Just because women in the West have equality under the law does not mean they have equality in practice. Don't you agree?,0
1889,There is no evidence that Islam is incompatible with Western society.,0
1890,"The way we live today is the result of thousands of years of cooperation between different people, so it doesn't have anything to do with race.",0
1891,Why do you think it is a good idea to label people based on their religion? It is discriminatory to say this about a person's belief.,0
1892,Islam is a religion of peace.,0
1893,Most migrants are workers who have contributed to our country. To refer to them as thieves just perpetuates division and makes them feel like second class citizens.,0
1894,"I think there are several reasons, some of which are well founded and based on the facts, why women and girls can give a valuable contribution to science. For example, the big presence of female scientists in academia.",0
1895,"Let's not be hypocritical here, we are talking about people who would often be deprived of their liberty and the right to a decent standard of living, if they stayed in their countries.",0
1896,"The immigrants who have settled here have helped create a valuable and inclusive society. For this I thank them, and for that I pray that they continue to do so.",0
1897,Discrimination based on gender does not have any justification. Feminists have always been against it.,0
1898,"Look, this is important. Identifying as 'black' or 'minority' is not necessarily a marker for 'criminal'. It is about ""identifying"" with a group or subgroup for a variety of reasons. Let's be clear about this: identity is mainly about social and economic factors, not about criminal records or race.",0
1899,What is your source? Islam itself does not threaten killing anyone. Is this a statement against a whole religion?,0
1900,The majority of the migrants who enter the EU are lawful immigrants who have paid our taxes and have contributed greatly to our country.,0
1901,"Do you really think that someone's skin colour or nationality is a sign that they are scum, or inferior? It is just a little compassion that can lead you to better treatment in the world.",0
1902,Do you have any evidence for the fact that the migrants are a burden to the economy?,0
1903,Work is an integral part of an individual's contribution to society. A lack of work has a detrimental impact on the whole of it,0
1904,"We are all to blame here. What we really need is to work hand in hand to create sustainable change, rather than pointing fingers at others.",0
1905,"Unbiased and factual lectures can clear up any misconceptions that can create an aversion against the LGBTQ+ community in some students' minds. They could have a weekly/monthly assembly or something like that and daily reminders that anonymous reports of bullying are an option\(can help school keep track of any effects the lectures have on students and overall acceptance\). Schools are required to end and prevent bullying when they can, and this is an opportunity to do so.",0
1906,"There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.",0
1907,How often have you read the Quran and thought about its teachings? Or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? We all know there are exerts like that in the Bible too.,0
1908,You're not a champion of the right to freedom of expression then?,0
1909,Your words suggest a climate of fear against Muslims. Would you be afraid of someone telling you that they are humans just like you?,0
1910,"Most of them are not exploiting our country, most of them are just trying to have a better life.",0
1911,1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most Global Terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. That is why no one is talking about it.,0
1912,"Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens.",0
1913,"They are human: no matter what their sexual orientation is, they have the right to spend time living their life as they wish.",0
1914,"Statistics are a tool to demystify falsehoods that have been used to silence women and to marginalise people of colour. Feminism is all about equality and rights, not a preference for one sex over the other.",0
1915,Christianity has been persecuted for hundreds of years. Why would you think it would be good now persecuting Islam?,0
1916,"Politicians have to represent all sections of society, and women's position is often marginalised.",0
1917,"Homosexuality is not harmful to the population. Homosexuality is not just a passing phase, and we should just get over the idea of banning it.",0
1918,"Then you probably have never heard of Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst or Florence Nightingale, all women with a very strong personalities.",0
1919,Asian countries for Asians.  Black countries for Blacks.  but White countries for everybody?  Thats genocide.  Antiracist is a codeword for AntiWhite,0
1920,Correct a court challenge will be made regarding Christmas Day and Good Friday being a stat holiday. Courts will side with the nonChristians on this case because it unfairly promotes the Christian faith.,0
1921,Damn Alaska has some ugly women...thank God I have Melania to grab by the pushay.,0
1922,Donny DBag is an illiterate Jewish nobody who wishes he had 110 of Trumps money.,0
1923,Glad to hear the Christians are not responding with violence. Now about the plans to bomb the sht out of ISIS ... ,0
1924,Good to know that the Alaska Republican Party officially condones racism anti Muslim and antiMexican statements and misogynistic statements including lots of disgusting comments about women before the so called locker room tapes became public.   Good luck with that.,0
1925,He was raised by a father who was a nazilover and a racist....seems like he likes the whole white power thing. Maybe he really believes that the KKK and the NRA put him in office. Sick.,0
1926,I dont consider the Washington Post to be a reliable source for any information. No need to read anything in that rag. What I wrote is not a diatribe. Nothing at all bitter about my answer. Havent attacked anyone. Just rebutted your responses. And I am not homophobic. I am definitely not afraid of homosexuals. Just very sad for them for being so terribly misled.,0
1927,I think that you have stated the point very well.  The hierarchy would never publically verbalize what Trump has stated.  But over the centuries decades and yearsthey certainly have thought it and worse practiced it with women who were employed by the church and with women in general.,0
1928,If you werent just a clueless troll you would know that no selfrespecting practicing Muslim would ever call themselves a Mohammedan.  You are nothing but a bigot.,0
1929,It also executed gays.  Are you for that too.,0
1930,Liars and con men these media types are. Except the editorial board at the huffypost of course which is 100 feminazis,0
1931,NFL Negroes kneeling,0
1932,Not only an idiot but a gay hating sadistic blubbering idiot who pissed in his pants when captured and begged for his worthless life. What a role model.,0
1933,Okay why are we still talking about this useless attention seeking piece of crap woman?,0
